Our School Advisory Committee (SAC) plays an important advisory role to the school. Our SAC Chairman and members work closely with the principal, staff and students, and give their strong support to enhance school development and programmes for student learning and welfare. The SAC also promotes a closer relationship between the community and the school. 

  

They are one of our key partners in our mission “To nurture our students to be Future-Ready by providing a Total Education in RVPS”. Our school is grateful to our SAC Chairman and members’ commitment towards our school’s progress and achievement of our school vision – Inspiring Learners, Edifying Leaders.
