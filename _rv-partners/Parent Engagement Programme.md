<p>At RV, we believe in fostering strong partnership with our parents to
better support the learning and development of our children. As such we
have a dedicated&nbsp;<strong>Parents Engagement Programme (aka PEP@RVPS)</strong>&nbsp;with
clear defined structures/platforms to guide us in nurturing the partnership.</p>
<p><strong>(I) Communications</strong>
</p>
<p>The school believes that regular communication with parents will allow
to have a more intimate understanding of their children’s learning and
growth in the school. Hence, we have the following avenues to reach out:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Principal’s termly letter outlining the new initiatives, school core programmes/
initiatives and calendar of events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Letters/Emails from form teachers and Year Heads to parents for each semester
so that parents know whom they need to contact with regard to their children’s
academic progress and behaviours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parents are also regularly informed of school activities and special functions
via platforms such as Parents’ Gateway, School website, Bi-annual RV Heartbeat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emails, class dojo, telephone calls and Zoom calls to correspond.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(II) Parents’ Involvement Platforms</strong>
</p>
<p>Nurturing home-school partnerships should not be premised on communications
per se. We believe that there must be platforms whereby parents could also
participate and get involved. Hence we have a two-tier approach to involve
our parents.</p>
<p>At Tier 1: Generic involvement of parents in their children’s learning,&nbsp;we
promote this initiative through the following:</p>
<p>(a) Briefing to Parents</p>
<p>School organizes several briefings to parents to help them better understand
the education landscape and how the school is supporting their children
through its programme offerings. Some briefings that we conduct include
P1 Meet the Parents session to help our P1 parents gain a better understanding
of the school’s programmes, Briefing for selected P1 parents on the Learning
Support Programme, Updates to the new PSLE and Sec 1 Posting systems for
P6 parents.</p>
<p>(b) Workshops for Parents</p>
<p>The workshops we organized annually for our parents in areas such as Math,
Science, Mother Tongue and English are well-received. For 2021, we will
also be adding on Cyber-wellness Workshop to support our parents in engaging
our children to exercise self- care when they are using the technological
affordances</p>
<p>Research has shown that parental involvement in school has many benefits
for the child and the parents, besides benefits for the school. As such
at &nbsp;Tier 2, we have parent volunteers (serving through the PSG)&nbsp;who
dedicate their time and efforts through their involvement in various school
programmes and activities&nbsp;to contribute to the holistic development
and well-being of RVians. Some activities that the PSG organises/ are involved
include Library Duties, English &amp; MT Storytelling and events such as
P6 Graduation Day, Children's Day and Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>For parents who are wavering if they should volunteer, being actively
involved in your child's learning journey at RVPS will certainly allow
you to forge a closer bond with your child. The privilege and opportunity
to make a difference in the lives of not just your children and also other
students in their journey through RVPS is invaluable. Should any parent

<p>For the immense support given by our volunteers, the school recognizes
through them via the following avenues:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Presented token of appreciation to PSG at Annual EOY prize presentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appreciation Reception to thank the parent volunteers for their contribution
in organisation of school events</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure that our PEP@RVPS remains useful and relevant to parents, we
would review its implementation annually. One of the sources that we use
to review is the feedback given by parents</p>
<p><strong>(III) Feedback</strong>
</p>
<p>Parents can give us their feedback through channels such as the End of
Year Parents’ survey, informal feedback through PSG, email correspondences
between parents and staff or telephone calls.</p>
