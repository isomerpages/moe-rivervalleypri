<h3><strong>Community Partnerships at River Valley Primary School</strong></h3>
<p>Community partnerships provide our students with rich and meaningful platforms
to enhance their development as socially responsible citizens by giving
them ownership of their contributions to the community. Over the years,
River Valley Primary School has built purposeful and sustainable partnerships
with key community partners, such as the Active Aging Centres (Chinatown
&amp; NTUC), Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH), the National
Environment Agency (NEA), Tanjong Pagar Town Council (Henderson-Dawson
Estate), Family Central (Tiong Bahru) and the Singapore Zoological Gardens.
These collaborations support the school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP)
and various Values-in-Action (VIA) initiatives.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Active Aging Centres (Chinatown &amp; NTUC)</h4>
<p>Through our collaboration with the Active Aging Centres, our Primary 5
students have the opportunity to choose and plan activities that they believe
will help seniors remain engaged and active. By teaching and engaging with
the seniors, our students not only build social connections but also develop
a greater awareness of, and empathy for, the needs of older adults. Additionally,
they gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for Singapore’s pioneer
generation, who have played a significant role in building our nation.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH)</h4>
<p>The collaboration with SAMH allows our Primary 6 students to play an active
role in making a difference within the mental health community. By becoming
champions for mental health, our students promote inclusivity and raise
awareness about mental health issues. They also have the opportunity to
plan the activities that they believe will aid the clients' recovery, helping
to foster empathy and support for those facing mental health challenges.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Tanjong Pagar Town Council (Henderson-Dawson Estate) </h4>
<p>In partnership with Tanjong Pagar Town Council (Henderson-Dawson Estate),
our Primary 6 students learn the importance of cleanliness and how to maintain
a clean environment. They bring back their learning to school and share
good practices, ensuring that River Valley Primary remains a clean and
conducive space for learning. This collaboration fosters a sense of civic
responsibility and community pride.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>National Environment Agency (NEA)</h4>
<p>Through our partnership with the National Environment Agency, our Primary
6 students learn about sustainable practices, especially when consuming
food in hawker centres. They also gain insights into how to preserve Singapore’s
hawker culture. This experience instills in them a strong sense of environmental
stewardship and an appreciation for the rich cultural heritage of Singapore’s
food scene.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Family Centre (Tiong Bahru)</h4>
<p>Over the years, our Student Councillors have been actively involved in
a meaningful partnership with the Family Centre (Tiong Bahru). Through
the Intergenerational Learning Programme, they plan and carry out a variety
of engaging activities – both online and in-person – for the elderly. From
teaching seniors how to create their own digital avatars to leading them
through virtual tours of Southeast Asian countries, our students bring
joy, laughter, and learning into the lives of the elderly. Beyond these
activities, the conversations and shared moments between generations create
mutual respect.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Singapore Zoological Gardens</h4>
<p>Our collaboration with the Singapore Zoological Garden offered Student
Councillors a unique platform to step into leadership roles while inspiring
their younger peers. In preparation, they participated in enriching training
sessions led by zoo facilitators, gaining first-hand insights into wildlife
care and conservation. Armed with this knowledge, they facilitated station-based
activities for our Primary 1 students – sparking curiosity about the natural
world and encouraging a sense of responsibility towards animal welfare.
It was a blend of learning, leadership, and advocacy in action.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>The Circular Classroom</h4>
<p>River Valley Primary School is proud to partner with The Circular Classroom
(TCC) in our shared mission to nurture a generation that values sustainability
and responsible consumption. This ongoing collaboration blends environmental
education with authentic, hands-on experiences that empower both students
and the wider school community to take action. The partnership came to
life through SG Go Green where TCC worked closely with our Parent Support
Group (PSG) to launch a uniform donation drive, while students created
engaging, sustainability-themed recess activities for their peers. By tapping
on each other’s strengths—TCC’s sustainability expertise and the school’s
vibrant community—we are cultivating a strong, values-driven culture of
care for the environment.</p>
