Parents Gateway is a mobile app that connects parents and schools on key administrative matters, allowing schools to send updates on programmes and activities to parents, and for parents to perform administrative functions such as providing consent for their children to participate in school activities.

  

It aims to aggregate parent-teacher communications securely on a centralised digital platform. It is integrated with existing MOE records systems, so updates will be reflected in Parents Gateway in real-time.
