<p>PAL @ RVPS is a 2-year programme that has been integrated as part of the
Primary 1 and 2 curriculum. Our students are provided with broad exposure
and experiences through fun and varied activities in the following modules:
Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts and Visual Arts.</p>
<p>The 5 PAL Learning Characteristics complement the CCE Curriculum framework
to allow RVians to apply the skills learnt for Social Emotional Competency
Domains (Social Awareness and Relationship Management, Responsible Decision
Making, Self-Awareness and Self-Management) in authentic, collaborative
and engaging lessons.</p>
<p></p>
<p>PAL provides opportunities for students to discover new interests, develop
character and enables them to develop social-emotional competencies through
the 5 learning domains of cognitive, moral, social, aesthetics and physical.
Each module runs weekly for 7-9 lessons depending on the schoolâ€™s calendar.
At the end of each lesson, students will share their reflection on their
learning experience with the class.</p>
