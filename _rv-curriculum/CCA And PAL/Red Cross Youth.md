Then what are you waiting for? Red Cross welcomes your child into our big family. In our Red Cross family, we learn to work in unity and care for the less fortunate in our society. Volunteerism begins at home and stretches around the globe. We participate actively in humanitarian works in our community and volunteer our services to the needy. Our Red Cross family is well-equipped with the necessary first aid skills to help sustain life. We also enrich ourselves through exciting outdoor activities like camps, rope lashing, tent pitching and more. The skills we learn in Red Cross are here to stay for life.

It is not a question of whether you "have what it takes," but of whether you take the gifts you have -- they are plenteous -- and share them with all the world. (Neale Donald Walsch)

A true Red Cross member lives up to the Red Cross Youth motto of “Humanity in our hands” – join us and be part of this giving community.
