River Valley Raven Cub Scouts is a CCA which provides a platform to self-development and self-discovery. We aim to create a close-knitted group environment which prepares boys to face and solve problems through courage, teamwork and creativity by providing boys with training programmes, outings and camps.

Our Scouting programmes have also won us a Frank Cooper Sands Gold Award for 2018 and our boys are constantly given the opportunities to participate in activities, competitions and camps in district, cluster, national and international level. With the exposure, we hope to develop our boys into motivated, independent and adaptable individuals, who are able to maintain harmonious relationships with others, and be a contributing member to the society.
