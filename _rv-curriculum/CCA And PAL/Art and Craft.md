“There are painters who transform the sun to a yellow spot, but there are others who with the help of their art and their intelligence, transform a yellow spot into sun” ― Pablo Picasso

In RV Art Club, we are not trying to create little artists like Picasso but to encourage our students to use their creativity to transform their thoughts into artworks, just like Picasso did.

The Art Club supports the RV Art curriculum which focuses on the artistic development of each child through exploration, experimentation and self evaluation of their creative processes. We provide interesting programmes for students who wish to pursue their art interest further. Here, the students are given ample opportunities to express their ideas and emotions through art-making. They will also learn to appreciate art in their various genre. Come and join the Art Club to have fun through art.
