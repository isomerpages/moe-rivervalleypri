In line with our four student-focused strategic objectives, RVPS works towards providing quality Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) programmes for our students. We believe that CCA is an important component of a child’s education. 

  

We believe in the importance of values education through CCA. Our teachers work collaboratively with our partners to deliver lessons with the infusion of the Character & Citizenship Education learning outcomes into our CCA unit plans. We offer a wide range of CCAs to cater to the different interests of our students.

  

Similar to the LEAPS Approach used by the secondary schools, we adopt it into development plan for our students to ensure the aspects on **Leadership, Enrichment, Achievement, Participation and Service-Learning are incorporated in our CCA programmes**. 

  

Our Primary 1 and Primary 2 students are enrolled in the **Programme for Active Learning (PAL)**. Please click here for more information on our PAL programme. To ensure that every student is involved in a CCA, RVPS has incorporated CCA as part of curriculum time.
