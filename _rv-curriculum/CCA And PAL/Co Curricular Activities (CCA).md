In line with our four student-focused strategic objectives, RVPS works towards providing quality Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) programmes for our students. We believe that CCA is an important component of a childâ€™s education.&nbsp;<br>

We believe in the importance of values education through CCA. Our teachers work collaboratively with our partners to deliver lessons with the infusion of the Character &amp; Citizenship Education learning outcomes into our CCA unit plans. We offer a wide range of CCAs to cater to the different interests of our students. <br>

Similar to the LEAPS Approach used by the secondary schools, we adopt it into development plan for our students to ensure the aspects on&nbsp;**Leadership, Enrichment, Achievement, Participation and Service-Learning&nbsp;are incorporated in our CCA programmes**.&nbsp;<br>

Our Primary 1 and Primary 2 students are enrolled in the&nbsp;**Programme for Active Learning (PAL)**.&nbsp;Please&nbsp;click here&nbsp;for more information on our PAL programme. To ensure that every student is involved in a CCA, RVPS has incorporated CCA as part of curriculum time.
