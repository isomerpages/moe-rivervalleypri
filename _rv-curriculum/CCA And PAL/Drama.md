RV Drama Club proudly performed an item for RV Speech and Prize Giving Day on 20 November 2020. It was originally slated for ELIS Conference 2020 for the English Language teaching fraternity but was cancelled due to COVID 19. The skit entitled Types of Talk was performed by Natalia Chua from 5 Confidence, Aw Le Xuan from 5 Diligence and Kim Too-Ri from 6 Graciousness.

It revolved around three characters who met at the entry gate in their quest to reach their destination. They each needed to be granted permission by the ‘EC Voice-box’ to pass and reach their destination. To enter, they had to demonstrate that they were effective communicators. However, they could not pass due to their ability to have and use only their one unique type of talk.

Eventually, the discussion among the three characters led them to understand the role of PACC , which the upper primary students would know as purpose, audience, context and culture. Together, they resolved their issues and learnt how to communicate effectively.

Our three young performers put up a splendid narrative and exemplified how it was important to have a repertoire of different communicative styles, attitudes and behaviours in our communication with others.
