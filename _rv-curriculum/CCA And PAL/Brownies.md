“Together with Girl Guides Singapore (GGS), RVPS Brownies aim to provide opportunities for girls to discover and develop their strengths and leadership skills. We encourage our girls to participate in various platforms such as our weekly CCA sessions and special GGS activities held with Brownies from other schools. Through fun and challenging programmes such as World Thinking Day, South Division Day and National Brownie Revel, RVPS Brownies will get to interact with other Brownies in a larger guiding community.

Brownies are encouraged to explore and discover the world around them, as well as to be more independent. By participating in our Pack Holiday Camps, Brownies forge unique experiences. Involvement in local and international communities through VIA and Outreach Programmes, equip our Brownies to make a lasting positive impact by helping others.

GGS activities and Pack Holiday Camps were conducted virtually on Zoom in 2021. It was a novel and exciting experience seeing our Brownies taking ownership and self-directedness in their Guiding journey, participating in events and activities despite the challenges faced. Everything a Brownie does is an adventure - it is a world of excitement, new interests and lasting friendships.

Be part of our Brownies family!”
