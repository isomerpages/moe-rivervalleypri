<p>The RVPS Dance Ensemble is a 60-member, mix-gender CCA focusing on international and street dance. We strive to provide a supportive environment for inspiring young dancers to develop their skills and character. During CCA sessions, students learn a combination of different techniques such as Hip-Hop and jazz moves. They also get a chance to perform in school events as well as external competitions.</p><p>Through a holistic training programme by caring and patience instructors, dancers learn important 21st&nbsp;century competencies such as self-awareness and self-management. School-based dance performances usually encompass the dance heritage of respective cultural contexts, allowing students to develop cross-cultural skills.</p><p>Below are some events that the Dance Ensemble took part in:</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA Dance/1.png"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA Dance/4.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA Dance/5.jpg"></div><p></p>
