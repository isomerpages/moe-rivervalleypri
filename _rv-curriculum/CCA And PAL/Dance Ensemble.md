The RVPS Dance Ensemble is a 70-member, mix-gender CCA focusing on international and street dance. We strive to provide a supportive environment for burgeoning dancers to develop their skills and character. During CCA sessions, students learn a combination of Jazz and Hip-Hop techniques as well as sequences taught by the instructors.

Through a holistic training programme, dancers learn important 21 st century competencies such as self-awareness and self-management. School-based dance performances usually encompass the dance heritage of respective cultural contexts, allowing students to develop cross-cultural skills.
