RVians who have a strong passion for music making as a team are welcomed. Under the guidance of the conductors and teachers, our Concert Band members develop their music talents and have performed in various platforms internally and externally. Examples of performances are Chinese New Year, National Day and Speech Day concerts in RVPS and the Singapore Garden Festival 2018 held at Gardens By The Bay.

The Concert Band is also an active participant in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and we are always proud of our Concert Band members as they put in their best efforts to bag achievements in the Arts Presentation.     

We are also actively involved in giving back to the society by partnering with Bishan Home for the intellectually disabled, where the Concert Band puts up a concert item to bring some joy and festivity to the Home.  

In the RV Concert band family, we organize in-house camps, trips to public concerts and school exchange programs to widen students’ repertoire of learning. As such, members not only learn, create and appreciate music, but they are also given opportunities to develop their sense of responsibility, independence and leadership qualities through the CCA.
