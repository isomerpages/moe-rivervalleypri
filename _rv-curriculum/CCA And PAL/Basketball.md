The RVPS Basketball CCA comprises of the Recreation Team, School Team and Competitive Team.

All players undergo an initial phase of training on Fridays during curriculum time - Recreation Team. Fundamental skills such as dribbling, passing and shooting are taught and honed during this period of time. This is to provide players with a strong foundation for more advanced skills.

As players progress, they are assessed at the end of each term on their potential. Through their display of commitment, attitude and conduct towards training, students may then be invited to join the as School Team and attend additional training sessions on Monday afternoons. Students may also be presented with opportunities to interact and play friendly matches with players from other schools.

School Team members will be assessed on an almost daily basis, before they are then selected to join the Competitive Team, where they will have the opportunity to represent River Valley Primary School for basketball tournaments.  
  
Our School's Values (Respect, Integrity, Compassion, Excellence) and the Olympic values (Friendship, Excellence, Respect) are the underpinning foundation of our approach to CCA participation. Through them, we aim to see our players develop their enjoyment of Basketball as well as develop strong values to help them in their daily lives.
