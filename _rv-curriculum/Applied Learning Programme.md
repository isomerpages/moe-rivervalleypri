<h3>Comms-It Rt!</h3>
<p>Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), Comms-It Rt!, is designed to nurture
students into confident and empathetic communicators. Through a structured
progression of communication skills, students go beyond presentations to
engage in civic discourse, learning to communicate effectively with diverse
audiences. Ultimately, we empower them to become agents of change, using
their voices to advocate for the greater good of the community.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Developing Communication Skills Across Primary Levels</u></strong></h4>
<h4>Lower Primary: Expressing Ourselves with Respect and Kindness</h4>
<p>At the foundational level, students learn to observe, respect, and share
ideas in a safe and supportive environment. They develop essential skills
in:</p>
