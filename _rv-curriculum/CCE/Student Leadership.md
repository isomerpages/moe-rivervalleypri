<h2><strong>Every RVian a Leader (ERaL)</strong></h2>
<p>Is leadership something we are born with, or is it a skill we develop?
At RVPS, we believe that every student has the potential to lead. Leadership
is no longer reserved for a select few—it is about equipping every RVian
with the mindset, skills, and values to make a positive impact.</p>
<h3>Our Leadership Philosophy</h3>
<p>At the heart of our approach are three key beliefs:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Every RVian can be developed as a leader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every RVian should be developed as a leader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leadership development must be intentional.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal is to shape transformational leaders who:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Understand that leadership is about influence, not position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are anchored in values and take responsibility for their actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inspire and collaborate with others toward a shared vision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contribute meaningfully to their communities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To bring this vision to life, we focus on the <strong>4Es of Leadership Development</strong>:
Equip, Enrich, Empower, and Explore.</p>
<h3><strong>The 4Es of Leadership Development</strong></h3>
<h4>Equip: Building a Strong Foundation</h4>
<p>RVians engage in progressive leadership lessons covering essential topics
such as school values, growth mindset, and the 7 Habits of Highly Effective
People. These interactive sessions incorporate group discussions, role-playing,
and hands-on activities, ensuring leadership concepts are internalized
over six years.</p>
<h4>Enrich: Learning Through Action</h4>
<p>Leadership comes to life through class-based and school-based roles, such
as Class Chairpersons, Peer Support Leaders, Student Councillors, and CCA
Leaders. These roles provide real-world opportunities for students to apply
leadership skills, collaborate with peers, and take on responsibilities
that extend beyond their classrooms.</p>
<h4>Empower: Stepping Up with Autonomy</h4>
<p>As students progress, they gain increasing autonomy:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Student-run activities:</strong> With teacher guidance, RVians
manage events and daily operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Student-led projects:</strong> Students take ownership, directing
projects with minimal supervision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Student-initiated initiatives:</strong> Students drive their own
ideas from conception to execution, demonstrating true leadership and innovation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Explore: Growing Through Reflection</h4>
<p>Leadership is a journey of continuous learning. At RVPS, we foster growth
through:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Goal Setting &amp; Reviews</strong> – Encouraging students to set
and track leadership goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Self-Assessment Checklists</strong> – Helping RVians evaluate their
leadership progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reflection Exercises</strong> – Enabling students to learn from
experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Student Awards</strong> – Recognizing outstanding leadership contributions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At RVPS, leadership is not just a title—it’s a way of thinking and acting.
By developing confident, responsible, and compassionate leaders, we empower
RVians to create positive change in their school and beyond.</p>
