The school’s VIA Framework seeks to provide a spectrum of learning experiences to improve on how our students and staff work and learn in school by:  

  

*   **Equipping** them with the values, knowledge and skills,  
    
*   **Enriching** their lives by keeping them curious to find and sustain the joy in learning,  
    
*   **Exploring** issues pertaining to school and community and,  
    
*   **Empowering** them to contribute to the community meaningfully  
    

  

Guided by the 3H (Head, Heart, Hand), the school’s VIA programme is part of a holistic education with a range of activities planned and implemented focusing on the following:

  

**Caring for School**: The Li’l Clean-up implemented in every class to care for their classrooms
