<p>The Values in Action (VIA) programme seeks to nurture socially responsible citizens who play an active role in contributing meaningfully to the community by learning and applying values, knowledge, and skills to make a difference. VIA is designed to encourage student ownership and initiative. As part of VIA, students reflect on their experiences, the values they have put into practice, and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully.</p>

<p>The school’s VIA Framework seeks to provide a spectrum of learning experiences to improve how our students and staff work and learn in school by:</p>

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
    <li>Equipping them with the values, knowledge, and skills,</li>
    <li>Enriching their lives by keeping them curious to find and sustain the joy in learning,</li>
    <li>Exploring issues pertaining to school and the community, and</li>
    <li>Empowering them to contribute to the community meaningfully.</li>
</ul>

<p>Guided by the 3H (Head, Heart, Hand), the school’s VIA programme is part of a holistic education with a range of activities planned and implemented focusing on the following:</p>


<h4>Caring for School - Appreciating the Guardians of RV</h4>

<p>In conjunction with Labour Day, students embark on projects such as Inviting Classrooms, Welcoming Library, Sparkling Canteen, Care Advocates, Supportive Squad, and Trash Busters to experience firsthand how our Guardians of RV carry out their duties in maintaining the safety and cleanliness of RVPS.</p>

<p>Guardians of RV include all staff (e.g., security guards, cleaners, operations support officers, librarian, ICT staff, teachers, and office staff) in RVPS.</p>

<p>This initiative allows RVians to experience what the Guardians of RV do daily, fostering appreciation for their hard work and dedication.</p>

<p>Through this project, students learn the importance of gratitude and empathy for those who contribute to their well-being, while also becoming active contributors in maintaining a clean and safe school environment.</p>

<h4>Level VIA</h4>

<p>Our level VIA is scaffolded to allow students to apply social and emotional competency skills, as well as values learned, so that they can be active contributors—starting from self, family, and school, gradually expanding to society, the nation, and beyond.</p>

<p>Some of our partner organisations where students have contributed include HCA Hospice, Chinatown Active Ageing Centre (CAAC), Farrer Road Residents’ Committee, Henderson-Dawson Town Council, Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH), and the National Environment Agency (NEA).</p>

<h4>CCA-Initiated VIA</h4>

<p>The CCA-Initiated VIA provides a platform for CCA members to become active contributors, using their interests and talents to promote social integration and friendships between diverse community groups. CCAs are encouraged to conduct VIA activities using the skills they acquire in CCA, enabling them to apply their learning to give back to society. CCAs also consider the needs of community groups to improve their lives, ensuring a meaningful and mutually beneficial partnership.</p>
