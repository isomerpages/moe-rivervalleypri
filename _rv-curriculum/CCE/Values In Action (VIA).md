The school’s VIA Framework seeks to provide a spectrum of learning experiences to improve on how our students and staff work and learn in school by:  

  

*   **Equipping** them with the values, knowledge and skills,  
    
*   **Enriching** their lives by keeping them curious to find and sustain the joy in learning,  
    
*   **Exploring** issues pertaining to school and community and,  
    
*   **Empowering** them to contribute to the community meaningfully  
    

  

Guided by the 3H (Head, Heart, Hand), the school’s VIA programme is part of a holistic education with a range of activities planned and implemented focusing on the following:

  

**Caring for School**: The Li’l Clean-up implemented in every class to care for their classrooms

The VIA programme in RVPS is also guided by the school’s Leadership Qualities, them being: Communication, Collaboration, Care and Responsibility. The VIAs planned for each level of students provide avenues for the students to sharpen their leadership skills by:

  

*   **Communication** – voicing out opinions and concerns about the community through class discussions; reflecting on their role as active contributors to the community; presenting their ideas to their class / school; raising awareness to the public through their interaction with them

  

*   **Collaboration** – through the brainstorming with ideas as a class and in groups to address the problems / concerns in the community; collaboration with partners like THK and NEA

  

*   **Care** – addressing issues / concerns with the community displays care for the environment; care for the elderly by engaging them in activities   
    

  

*   **Responsibility** – as concerned citizens of Singapore by being responsible for the cleanliness in the classroom environment, the school environment and the community (hawker centres)
