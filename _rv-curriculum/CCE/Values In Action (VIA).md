<p>The Values in Action (VIA) programmes seeks to nurture socially responsible
citizens who plays an active role in contributing meaningfully to the community
by the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills to make
a difference. VIA is designed to engender student ownership and initiative.
As part of VIA, students reflect on their experience, the values they have
put into practice, and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully.</p>
<p>The school’s VIA Framework seeks to provide a spectrum of learning experiences
to improve on how our students and staff work and learn in school by:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Equipping&nbsp;them with the values, knowledge and skills,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enriching&nbsp;their lives by keeping them curious to find and sustain
the joy in learning,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exploring&nbsp;issues pertaining to school and community and,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Empowering&nbsp;them to contribute to the community meaningfully</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Guided by the 3H (Head, Heart, Hand), the school’s VIA programme is part
of a holistic education with a range of activities planned and implemented
focusing on the following:</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Caring for School - Appreciating the Guardians of RV</h4>
<p>In conjunction with Labour Day, students embark on projects such as Inviting
Classrooms, Welcoming Library, Sparkling Canteen, Care Advocates, Supportive
Squad and Trash Busters to have a hands on experience of how our Guardians
of RV have carried out their duties of monitoring the safety and cleanliness
to keep RVPS a safe and conducive environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guardians of RV includes all staff (eg. security guards, cleaners, operations
support officers, librarian, ICT staff, teachers and office staff) in RVPS.</p>
<p>This helps our RVians to personally experience what the Guardians of RV
have been doing on a daily basis and better appreciate the efforts and
hard work put in by our Guardians of RV.</p>
<p>Through this project, students learnt the importance of gratitude and
empathy of the efforts put in by the people who has contributed to the
betterment of their lives as well as be an active contributor to the school
to keep it clean and safe.</p>

<h4>Level VIA</h4>
<p>Our level VIA is scaffolded to allow students to apply social and emotional
competency skills as well as values learnt so that they can be an active
contributor starting from self, family, school and gradually to the society,
nation and beyond.
<br>
<br>Some of our partner organisations that our students have contributed and
made a difference to include HCA Hospice, Chinatown Active Ageing Centre
(CAAC), Farrer Road Residents’ Committee, Henderson-Dawson Town Council
and Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) and National Environment
Agency (NEA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>CCA-Initiated VIA</h4>
<p>The CCA-Initiated VIA provides a platform to develop CCA members into
active contributors, who through their interest and talents are able to
contribute meaningfully to the community to promote social integration
and friendships between diverse community groups.</p>
<p>CCAs are encouraged to conduct the VIA activities using the acquired skills
from CCA to enable students to apply their learning to contribute back
to society.</p>
<p>CCAs take into account community group’s needs so that they can improve
or brighten the lives of the community group as well as achieve the aim
of VIA, ensuring a right fit between both CCA and community.</p>
