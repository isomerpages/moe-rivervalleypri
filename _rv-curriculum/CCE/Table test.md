          This lesson focuses on helping students identify the emotions and
          stress caused by physical changes during puberty. Students will
          learn to describe healthy ways to manage their negative feelings
          during this time. They will also learn to recognize that one’s
          identity need not be negatively affected, even when one’s body is
          experiencing changes due to puberty.

          This lesson focuses on helping students know what pornography is
          and how it can affect themselves and others. Students will learn
          about the dangers of being exposed to sexually explicit materials
          and reject the viewing and/or reading of pornographic materials.
          They will learn to evaluate their own responses when they
          encounter pornography by applying the strategy
          <strong>‘Stop-Think-Do’.</strong>
