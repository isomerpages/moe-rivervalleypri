National Education in RVPS is guided by a framework that articulates the NE goals and approaches. Students acquire socio-cultural sensitivity and Social Emotional competencies through Learning Journeys and Values-In-Action Programmes. Structured reflection is also incorporated in the activities to enable students to internalize their learning. A school-wide approach is adopted to infuse National Education into curriculum and school programmes.

There are also 4 NE Core Events and Celebrations in a year; namely Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day to enable students to appreciate our national identity and develop a sense of belonging to the country. NE Ambassadors are appointed to play significant roles in inculcating the six NE messages in their peers. Trainings for NE ambassadors are held at least once in each term to empower them with the necessary skills to lead the school in our NE journey.Â In the classrooms, students were engaged in a myriad of classroom activities, discussions and group work on how they can play their part. Students were taught that there are many areas in their lives, be it in school or at home, where they can contribute to a strong and resilient Singapore.
