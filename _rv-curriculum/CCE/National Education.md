<p>River Valley Primary School (RVPS) takes a comprehensive and structured
approach to National Education (NE) as part of its Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE) efforts. By weaving together various elements like commemorative
days, the Social Studies curriculum, Cohort Learning Journeys, and Values-In-Action
(VIA) programs, the school aims to nurture well-rounded students with the
social-emotional and emerging 21st-century competencies necessary to thrive
in a globalized world while staying grounded in their Singaporean identity.</p>
<p>This approach emphasizes both personal growth and civic responsibility.
The key dispositions for citizenship—A Sense of Belonging, A Sense of Reality,
A Sense of Hope, and The Will to Act—guide students to understand their
role within their community and nation, equipping them with the mindset
and skills needed to contribute meaningfully to society. The focus on social-emotional
competencies like self-awareness and relationship management aligns well
with fostering students' ability to navigate diverse social contexts, make
responsible decisions, and develop a sense of empathy and global citizenship.</p>
<p>Structured reflection is also incorporated into each NE Commemorative
day for our students to reflect on their experience and deepen their learning
through a progressive approach with the Primary 1 and 2 students promoting
awareness, Primary 3 and 4 students taking action to improve on the current
situation and the Primary 5 and 6 students being the advocates to inspire
and influence others to make a difference.</p>
<p>NE ambassadors across the various levels are also appointed to empower
them to take greater ownership of our school’s NE efforts and further reinforce
their sense of responsibility and leadership. By serving as spokespersons
and facilitators, these students not only deepen their understanding of
NE concepts but also become role models for their peers, encouraging active
participation in a myriad of classroom and lunch activities as well as
assembly and pre-assembly talks.</p>
