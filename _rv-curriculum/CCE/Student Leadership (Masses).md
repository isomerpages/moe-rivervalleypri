<h2><b>Every RVian a Leader (ERaL)</b></h2>

<p>Is leadership something we are born with, or is it a skill we develop? At RVPS, we believe that every student has the potential to lead. Leadership is no longer reserved for a select few—it is about equipping every RVian with the mindset, skills, and values to make a positive impact.</p>


<h3>Our Leadership Philosophy</h3>
<p>At the heart of our approach are three key beliefs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Every RVian can be developed as a leader.</li>
  <li>Every RVian should be developed as a leader.</li>
  <li>Leadership development must be intentional.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our goal is to shape transformational leaders who:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understand that leadership is about influence, not position.</li>
  <li>Are anchored in values and take responsibility for their actions.</li>
  <li>Inspire and collaborate with others toward a shared vision.</li>
  <li>Contribute meaningfully to their communities.</li>
</ul>

<p>To bring this vision to life, we focus on the <strong>4Es of Leadership Development</strong>: Equip, Enrich, Empower, and Explore.</p>


<h3>The 4Es of Leadership Development</h3>


<h4>Equip: Building a Strong Foundation</h4>
<p>RVians engage in progressive leadership lessons covering essential topics such as school values, growth mindset, and the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. These interactive sessions incorporate group discussions, role-playing, and hands-on activities, ensuring leadership concepts are internalized over six years.</p>


<h4>Enrich: Learning Through Action</h4>
<p>Leadership comes to life through class-based and school-based roles, such as Class Chairpersons, Peer Support Leaders, Student Councillors, and CCA Leaders. These roles provide real-world opportunities for students to apply leadership skills, collaborate with peers, and take on responsibilities that extend beyond their classrooms.</p>


<h4>Empower: Stepping Up with Autonomy</h4>
<p>As students progress, they gain increasing autonomy:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Student-run activities:</strong> With teacher guidance, RVians manage events and daily operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Student-led projects:</strong> Students take ownership, directing projects with minimal supervision.</li>
  <li><strong>Student-initiated initiatives:</strong> Students drive their own ideas from conception to execution, demonstrating true leadership and innovation.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Explore: Growing Through Reflection</h4>
<p>Leadership is a journey of continuous learning. At RVPS, we foster growth through:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Goal Setting &amp; Reviews</strong> – Encouraging students to set and track leadership goals.</li>
  <li><strong>Self-Assessment Checklists</strong> – Helping RVians evaluate their leadership progress.</li>
  <li><strong>Reflection Exercises</strong> – Enabling students to learn from experiences.</li>
  <li><strong>Student Awards</strong> – Recognizing outstanding leadership contributions.</li>
</ul>


<p>At RVPS, leadership is not just a title—it’s a way of thinking and acting. By developing confident, responsible, and compassionate leaders, we empower RVians to create positive change in their school and beyond.</p>
