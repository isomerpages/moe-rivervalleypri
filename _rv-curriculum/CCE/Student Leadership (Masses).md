In RVPS, every child matters, and we believe that every RVian can be a leader. In line with the school motto of “Inspiring Learners, Edifying Leaders”, the **Every RVian a Leader (ERaL)** programme aims to provide the platform for our students to apply and showcase their leadership qualities.

Through this programme, every student will be able to learn and grow as an effective leader, through adopting **7 Habits** and displaying the **4 Leadership Qualities (LQs)** of Communication, Collaboration, Care and Responsibility.

The 7 habits are gradually introduced in the students’ 6 years in RV to allow deep learning and effective application. They will learn the concepts of these habits and link knowledge to application through scenario-based questions, group discussions, sharing of ideas/ views during the termly trainings. Trainings will be progressive from application to self, others then community.

These leadership qualities will be developed through the **4Es** approach, namely **Equip, Enrich, Empower** **and Explore.**

#### Equip

The school has adopted the Leader in Me leadership model to support the students in becoming effective leaders. With the ERaL programme, students will be given ample opportunities to learn and grow by exploring the different roles in class in the span of their 6 years in RVPS. This is done through rotating the different leadership roles in class for P1 and P2 students, while the P3 – P6 students will go through termly ERaL trainings. During the trainings, students get to learn more about their leadership roles and discover how the 7 Habits can help them to showcase their leadership qualities.

#### Enrich

Under the ERaL programme, students will also be given ample opportunities to learn and grow by exploring the different roles in class in the span of their 6 years in RVPS. Termly trainings are conducted by teachers to cater to the learning needs of the different groups of students undertaking different leadership roles in class. The training sessions aim to enrich their learning experiences by providing students strong support from their teachers.

#### Explore

The student handbook is used for students to reflect and explore ways in which they can better themselves as leaders in the school. During the training sessions, teachers will guide students in their goal setting monitoring of progress and reflections. Students are encouraged to explore the different ways they can stretch themselves and contribute as a leader.

#### Empower

In the leadership training of the student masses, all students are empowered to take charge of their assigned duties/school events for the year. Hence, the different community of students will work among themselves to discuss and plan the best way to achieve the different tasks dutifully. Together with reflections and termly monitoring, we hope that all students will go through a leadership journey of personal reflections and growth.
