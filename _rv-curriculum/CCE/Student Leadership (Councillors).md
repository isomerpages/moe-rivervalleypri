In RVPS, every child matters, and we believe that every RVian can be a leader. Thus, **Every RVian A Leader** programme aims to provide a total education that is value-driven and student-centric, so as to nurture our students to the best of their abilities.

In inculcating strength of character in our students, a school-wide approach is adopted whereby the staff and key partners are involved in developing the students’ leadership qualities. The students will acquire four key leadership qualities of Communication, Collaboration, Care and Responsibility at the end of six years and the development of these qualities will be through the 4Es approach, namely Equip, Enrich, Empower and Explore. The school also adopted 7 Habits of Highly Effective People as part of our training programme such that student councillors can acquire progressive leadership skills to be independent and interdependent.

#### Equip

Through the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, student councillors will get to work on their personal 
and leadership growth. Platforms are also made available to them so that they can 
edify other leaders and commit themselves in taking responsibilities for the environment they live in. 
We also collaborate with Mandai Zoo for the Wildlife Buddy Programme to train them as facilitators
to guide younger students around the zoo. Through the training, they learnt to care for animals and be
their voices. The interaction with the younger students empowered them to learn how to communicate
as a leader and to show care for others.

We also collaborate with Singapore Civil Defence Force in training the student councillors to be Junior Lionhearters. By taking on the role as community leaders, the student councillors are strong advocates for emergency preparedness.

#### Enrich

Various platforms are made available to the student councillors to enrich their leadership
experiences in school. Termly trainings are conducted by the teachers to cater to their learning 
needs such that they learn communication and organisation skills and heighten their self-awareness 
on how they can play a proactive role in serving the school and community. Senior councillors also
guide the junior and trainee councillors through sharing of experiences and role-play sessions.

Students also get to go on learning journeys to enrich their experiences and share their learning 
with their peers. Student councillors are also given opportunities to edify the younger students 
through our Wildlife Buddy Programme and Kindergarten Visits.

#### Explore

Through regular reflections, student councillors deepen their learning and explore ways in which they 
can better themselves as leaders in our training programmes. 
The school also explores opportunities for the student councillors to widen their horizons and deepen
their understanding and learning through collaboration with agencies like Family Service Centre and NEA. 
In the selection of trainee student councillors, a rigorous four-step approach is employed to assess 
students’ suitability as student councillors. This allows for a better fit of students’ leadership potential 
based on school needs and their passion to learn and lead. 


#### Empower

Student councillors are also empowered to take charge of their assigned level projects
for the year with guidance from teachers. Hence, this provides opportunities for the student councillors 
to synergise and sharpen their saws in the planning and implementation of the projects.  

Through event-based reflections, student councillors will grow in a leadership journey of 
personal reflections and self-improvements.
