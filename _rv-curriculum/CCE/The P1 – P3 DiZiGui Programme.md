The teachings of DiZiGui （《弟子规》） is incorporated into our lower primary CCE MT curriculum to enhance students’ learning of traditional moral values.  Animations depicting scenarios closely related to students’ daily lives help them relate to how morals and values are applied in various contexts, thus developing their ability to exercise judgement premised on sound morals and values.
