The teachings of DiZiGui （《弟子规》） is incorporated into our lower primary CCE MT curriculum to enhance students’ learning of traditional moral values.  Animations depicting scenarios closely related to students’ daily lives help them relate to how morals and values are applied in various contexts, thus developing their ability to exercise judgement premised on sound morals and values.

##### Classroom discussion on Current affairs

  

Our upper primary CCE MT makes use of issues in current affairs for students to examine real life case studies against the backdrop of morals and values. Students engage in discussions and sharing of opinions through the use of real life case studies in news articles, facilitating their understanding of how values are applied in real life contexts, thus serving to strengthen the values and character of students.
