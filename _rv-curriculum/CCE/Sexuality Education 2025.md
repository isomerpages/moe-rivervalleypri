<h4><strong>MOE SEXUALITY EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS</strong></h4>
<p>1. Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools aims to enable students to understand
the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they
mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships with others, including
those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible
decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the
family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual
marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support.
The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and
beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore
on sexuality issues.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. The Goals of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a) Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional
changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.</p>
<p>(b) Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on
sexuality matters.</p>
<p>(c) Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and
others by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality
that are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. The Key Messages of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a) Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p>(b) Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are
the foundation for strong families);</p>
<p>(c) Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society;
and</p>
<p>(d) Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV
and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
ones.</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Sexuality Education Lessons:</u></strong>
</p>
<p>6. The upper primary years mark the onset of puberty. With better nutrition
and improved health care, children are reaching puberty at a younger age
and have to grapple with physical, emotional and psychological changes
in themselves. The implication is that our children are becoming biologically
ready for sexual activity sooner without necessarily having the corresponding
cognitive or emotional maturity to modulate their behaviours. Furthermore,
our young are also exposed to a wide range of influences that could endanger
health and undermine the integrity of the family. Our students require
close guidance so that they can respond with discernment to the sexual
messages in the media and other sources.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7. Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons are taught as part of CCE (FTGP)
at Primary 5 and 6. Through these lessons, students will learn healthy
ways to manage the physiological, social and emotional changes in their
growing years. They learn to build healthy and rewarding relationships
with others, including those with members of the opposite sex. Students
are also guided to make wise, informed and responsible decisions to keep
themselves safe from sexuality-related risks.</p>
<p><strong>At River Valley Primary School, the following Sexuality Education lessons will be taught in 2025:</strong>

          This lesson focuses on helping students identify the emotions and
          stress caused by physical changes during puberty. Students will
          learn to describe healthy ways to manage their negative feelings
          during this time. They will also learn to recognize that one’s
          identity need not be negatively affected, even when one’s body is
          experiencing changes due to puberty.

          They will learn to evaluate their own responses when they
          encounter pornography by applying the strategy
          <strong>‘Stop-Think-Do’.</strong>

          In this lesson, students will learn to distinguish between the
          characteristics of love and infatuation, and identify the strong
          emotions that may arise from experiencing the feelings of
          infatuation. They will recognise that experiencing feelings of
          infatuation is part of growing up and becoming infatuated with
          someone does not mean that they should be involved in a romantic
          relationship. Instead, they should focus on building strong and
          healthy friendships with their circles of friends.

          In this lesson, students will learn healthy ways to manage the
          emotions arising from infatuation and recognise the importance of
          respecting the boundaries of any relationship. They will also
          recognise the negative impact of teasing their peers who may be
          experiencing the feelings of infatuation and learn to behave
          maturely towards each other.
