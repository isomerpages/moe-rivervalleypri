<h4>Student Well-Being</h4>
<p>In the six years of Primary education in RVPS, our students will experience
joyful moments and encounter challenging situations in their lives, both
in school and at home. Our teachers play a key role in establishing a Caring
and Enabling School Environment to proactively monitoring and supporting
our students’ well-being and holistic development by fostering a nurturing
learning environment and cultivating positive teacher-student relationships
and peer relationship as these are the powerful protective factors for
student well-being.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Termly Check-In Surveys</h4>
<p>Changes that can affect a student’s well-being could take place at any
time of the year. The check-in surveys (MOE Check-In Survey – Term 1 and
3 and RVPS Student Perception Survey – Term 2 and 4) provide students with
a safe and regular channel to share information about themselves. Form
teachers can obtain a sensing of their students’ social support network
and well-being and recognize warning signs in their students during lesson
activities and/or from their responses to the check-in surveys.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>CCE lesson - Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)</h4>
<p>CCE FTGP is one of the key learning platforms where Form Teachers enact
teaching and learning of CCE intentionally to explicitly teach values,
and social and emotional skills, which addresses the holistic developmental
needs of our students, equipping them with the knowledge and skills to
better understand and navigate the real-world, e.g. understand metal health
issues, navigate cyberspace responsibly, make appropriate educational and
career choices, appreciate family life, understand Singapore’s racial and
religious diversity.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>One-To-One Conversation</h4>
<p>The check-in surveys’ findings are used as a conversation starter by the
form teachers to connect with their students during the One-To-One Conversation
on a weekly basis. The One-To-One Conversation are tiered according to
the various levels to support the developmental needs of our students progressively
and build their self-esteem and self-awareness based on the three CCE themes
of Becoming My Best Self, Building Connections and Making Choices.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Peer Support and Relationship</h4>
<p>A strong peer support culture can provide timely alerts to teachers and
allow prompt support and intervention. In RVPS, we adopt the tiered peer
support approach. The tiered peer support strategy is a great way to foster
a sense of responsibility and community among students. By involving everyone
in the first tier through Peer Bonding, Peer Helping, and Peer Influencing,
we are encouraging empathy and collaboration from the very beginning. The
second tier with Peer Support Ambassadors also adds an extra layer of leadership
and support, allowing for more focused attention on students who might
need additional help.</p>

<h3><strong>Level Initiatives</strong></h3>
<h4>Writing Notes of Encouragement</h4>
<p>River Valley Primary School fosters a sense of community and care among
its students. Encouragement and support like this can truly make a difference,
not just in academic performance, but also in building empathy and solidarity
between students of different ages.</p>
<p>The idea of having the Primary 3 students write motivational notes to
the Primary 6 students before their PSLE is so thoughtful. It encourages
the younger students to take pride in supporting their older peers, while
also helping the Primary 6 students feel uplifted and supported during
a stressful time. And the reciprocation—Primary 6 students writing back
to their Primary 3 buddies before their own Semestral Assessment—is a beautiful
way to complete the circle of care and positivity.</p>
<p>By engaging in this activity, the students not only work on academic success
but also develop emotional intelligence, kindness, and collaboration, which
will help them throughout their lives. It is definitely a powerful way
to create a culture of care in River Valley Primary School.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>P1 and P4 Buddy during Orientation</h4>
<p>Having the Primary 4 students as buddies is a great approach to help the
Primary 1 students adjust to the new school environment, as it not only
makes them feel welcomed but also encourages the older students to take
on leadership roles and become role models.</p>
<p>The welcome card is a personal touch that helps the Primary 1 students
feel special and supported from the very beginning. It is such a warm way
to kickstart their school experience. The Primary 4 students' role in showing
the Primary 1 students the basics of school life, like washing hands before
eating, queuing for food, and cleaning up afterward, teaches the little
ones important habits and routines in a caring and patient way. It also
allows the Primary 4 students to practice responsibility, patience, and
empathy.</p>
