<h3><strong>Student Well-Being</strong></h3>
<p>In the six years of Primary education in RVPS, our students will experience
joyful moments and encounter challenging situations in their lives, both
in school and at home. Our teachers play a key role in establishing a Caring
and Enabling School Environment to proactively monitor and support our
students’ well-being and holistic development by fostering a nurturing
learning environment and cultivating positive teacher-student relationships
and peer relationship as these are the powerful protective factors for
student well-being.</p>
<h3>Termly Check-In Surveys</h3>
<p>Changes that can affect a student’s well-being could take place at any
time of the year. The check-in surveys (MOE Check-In Survey – Term 1 and
3 and RVPS Student Perception Survey – Term 2 and 4) provide students with
a safe and regular channel to share information about themselves. Form
teachers can obtain a sensing of their students’ social support network
and well-being and recognize warning signs in their students during lesson
activities and/or from their responses to the check-in surveys. Form teachers
can then follow up on these signs and check-in with the students.</p>
<h3>CCE lesson - Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)</h3>
<p>CCE FTGP is one of the key learning platforms where Form Teachers enact
teaching and learning of CCE intentionally to explicitly teach values,
and social and emotional skills, which addresses the holistic developmental
needs of our students, equipping them with the knowledge and skills to
better understand and navigate the real-world, e.g. understand metal health
issues, navigate cyberspace responsibly, make appropriate educational and
career choices, appreciate family life, understand Singapore’s racial and
religious diversity. CCE FTGP also ties in with Peer Support and Cyber
Wellness topics and is a platform for teachers to reinforce these key messages
to students.</p>
<h3>One-To-One Conversation</h3>
<p>The check-in surveys’ findings are used as a conversation starter by the
form teachers to connect with their students during the One-To-One Conversation
on a weekly basis. The One-To-One Conversation are tiered according to
the various levels to support the developmental needs of our students progressively
and build their self-esteem and self-awareness based on the three CCE themes
of Becoming My Best Self, Building Connections and Making Choices.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Peer Support and Relationship</h3>
<p>A strong peer support culture can provide timely alerts to teachers and
allow prompt support and intervention. In RVPS, we adopt the tiered peer
support approach. The tiered peer support strategy is a great way to foster
a sense of responsibility and community among students. By involving everyone
in the first tier through Peer Bonding, Peer Helping, and Peer Influencing,
we are encouraging empathy and collaboration from the very beginning. The
second tier with Peer Support Ambassadors also adds an extra layer of leadership
and support, allowing for more focused attention on students who might
need additional help.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Cyber Wellness</h3>
<p>In River Valley Primary School, we aim to equip our students with the
knowledge and skills to harness the power of technology for positive purposes,
maintain a positive presence in the cyberspace and be safe and responsible
users of technology. Through the Cyber Wellness programmes and activities,
students understand the norms of responsible behaviour regarding technology
use as well as knowledge, skills, values and attitudes on how to protect
oneself and other users in the cyber world through the key topics of Cyber
Use, Cyber Relationships, Cyber Identity, Cyber Citizenship and Cyber Ethics.
We adopt the tiered approach by involving everyone in the first tier so
that students are responsible for their personal well-being in the cyberspace.
The second tier with Cyber Wellness Ambassadors adds an additional layer
of leadership in navigating the online space, spreading awareness and advocating
for the safe and responsible online use.</p>

<p>Students learn the three principles: ‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’ to guide their decision-making and anchor their well-being in the cyber world. Through Cyber Wellness programme in the school, students are reminded to:</p>

<p>The partnership between parents and children is essential in promoting
safe and responsible digital use. The Ministry of Health’s updated guidance
provides a clear indication for how parents can manage their children's
screen time, especially in an age where technology is an integral part
of daily life. By limiting screen time to under two hours per day for children
aged 7-12, and ensuring that it is primarily for educational purposes,
parents can help create a healthy balance between online and offline activities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here are some practical ways parents can reinforce cyber wellness at home:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Set Parental Controls and Discuss Family Guidelines:</strong> Establishing
parental controls on devices and discussing clear rules with the children
is vital. This allows for more transparency and shared understanding of
what's appropriate, while also promoting a sense of responsibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Have Open Conversations About Digital Use:</strong> Encourage regular,
open conversations about your child's online experiences. This helps parents
stay informed and connected to what their children are doing online, and
it provides a chance to address any concerns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be Involved and Engaged:</strong> Show genuine interest in your
child's online interests and activities. This not only strengthens your
relationship but also gives you the opportunity to guide them on making
thoughtful and respectful decisions when using technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encourage Time Management:</strong> Help your child monitor their
screen time by discussing how much time they are spending online and guiding
them in managing it. This can be an opportunity to teach them how to strike
a balance between engaging in digital activities and enjoying offline hobbies
or spending time with family and friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Turn Online Activities into Bonding Moments:</strong> Rather than
seeing digital time as a solitary activity, try to incorporate shared moments
like co-viewing videos, playing video games together, or discussing interesting
online content. This helps foster communication and strengthens bonds while
also reinforcing digital wellness in a fun, engaging way.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>Involving children in discussions about their digital lives and offering
guidance helps to foster responsible digital citizens who can enjoy the
benefits of technology while minimizing its risks. By taking an active
role, parents can support their children in becoming mindful and balanced
users of digital devices.</p>

<h3><strong>Level Initiatives</strong></h3>
<h4>Writing Notes of Encouragement</h4>
<p>River Valley Primary School fosters a sense of community and care among
its students. Encouragement and support like this can truly make a difference,
not just in academic performance, but also in building empathy and solidarity
between students of different ages.</p>
<p>The idea of having the Primary 3 students write motivational notes to
the Primary 6 students before their PSLE is a thoughtful act. It encourages
the younger students to take pride in supporting their older peers, while
also helping the Primary 6 students feel uplifted and supported during
a stressful time. And the reciprocation—Primary 6 students writing back
to their Primary 3 buddies before the Primary 3 own Semestral Assessment—is
a beautiful way to complete the circle of care and positivity.</p>
<p>By engaging in this activity, the students not only work on academic success
but also develop emotional intelligence, kindness, and collaboration, which
will help them throughout their lives. It is definitely a powerful way
to create a culture of care in River Valley Primary School.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>P1 and P4 Buddy during Orientation</h4>
<p>Having the Primary 4 students as buddies is a great approach to help the
Primary 1 students adjust to the new school environment, as it not only
makes them feel welcomed but also encourages the older students to take
on leadership roles and become role models.</p>
<p>The welcome card is a personal touch that helps the Primary 1 students
feel special and supported from the very beginning. It is such a warm way
to kickstart their school experience. The Primary 4 students' role in showing
the Primary 1 students the basics of school life, like washing hands before
eating, queuing for food, and cleaning up afterward, teaches the little
ones important habits and routines in a caring and patient way. It also
allows the Primary 4 students to practice responsibility, patience, and
empathy.</p>
