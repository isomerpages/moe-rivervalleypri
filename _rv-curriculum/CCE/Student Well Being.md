In River Valley Primary School, we believe in building a strong culture of care built on the solid foundation of our school’s values of Respect, Integrity, Compassion and Excellence. Our teachers help students develop 21st century competencies through daily classroom interaction and beyond. In addition, we believe in the holistic development of our students and recognise the importance of students’ well-being in maximising their potential so that they may lead purposeful lives. 

We have dedicated and caring teachers who spend time and effort getting to know each child individually, ensuring a strong and positive Teacher-Student Relationship (TSR) that lays the foundation for an enriching school experience. When students view their teachers as caring and supportive, they are more likely to be academically motivated and engaged, as well as to be able to regulate their own behaviour to act responsibly.

Built on a caring culture, our students learn to care, lead, support, show kindness and appreciation to peers, teachers, parents, the school attendants and the less fortunate.

  

#### Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)

  

FTGP is an important component of Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) which encompasses the explicit teaching of Social and Emotional (SE) competencies (including Cyber Wellness and Education and Career Guidance) and building TSR.SE learning teaches our students the need to handle themselves, relationships, and work both effectively and ethically. These skills include recognising and managing their emotions, developing care and concern for others, establishing positive relationships, making responsible decisions, and handling challenging situations effectively.

  

#### 1-to-1 Interaction

  

Form Teachers play an important role in shaping the development of the students, and  understanding their well-being. Hence, during FTGP, there are interaction activities and discussions to address issues and reinforce core values to enable students to apply them in real-life situations.

To enhance interaction and bonding time with form teachers, River Valley has implemented 1-to-1 interaction time, conducted during FTGP and allocated assembly slots. FTs have conversations with students individually to understand them better and give students encouragement on their good qualities. Students share about their strengths and interests as part of the Education and Career Guidance (ECG) framework. After which, form teachers will write 1-to-1 notes to students to affirm or provide feedback on their progress.

  

#### Peer Support and Relationship

  

River Valley has a strong peer-support culture where students contribute to the caring and positive peer culture in school when they look out for one another and provide support to their peers in need. With a peer support mind-set, students create a community of care and support among peers and build positive relationships with one another. We strengthen our peer support efforts (e.g. appointing peer support leaders, buddy system for new students) by promoting a supportive peer culture in school. We also equip all students with knowledge and skills to look out for and support one another especially during times of distress.

### Level Initiatives
-----------------


#### Appreciating the Guardians of RV

  

In conjunction with Labour Day, the Primary 2 students took the opportunity to show their appreciation for the Guardians of RV by writing ‘thank you’ notes to them. The Guardians of RV refer to our security guards, the ‘Aunties’ and ‘Uncles’ who ensure that our environment is safe and clean for our teaching and learning.

Prior to that, the Guardians of RV were invited to the P2 classes during Values Education lessons for students to get to know them better and to understand their jobs and duties in schools. The Guardians of RV also share advices to our P2 students on safety and cleanliness in school.

Through this activity, students learn the importance of gratitude and showing appreciation to people who has contributed to the betterment of their lives.

#### Writing Notes of Encouragement

  

Everyone needs a little encouragement every now and again. Prior to PSLE, our P3 students will write a note to our P6 students to motivate them to do well in PSLE, put a bounce in their step and a smile on their face and show support and care with a note of encouragement. In return, the P6 students will reciprocate the kind gesture by writing a personalised note back to the P3 students before their SA2 examinations.

Through this activity, students are able to forge strong social bonds by showing care and love to others. This also creates a culture of care in River Valley Primary School.

**P1 and P4 Buddy during Orientation**  

P4 students are assigned to help our P1 ease into Primary school life. P4 handed welcome card for their respective buddy upon meeting them. The big brothers and sisters demonstrate to the P1s the steps of washing hands before eating. They teach them how to queue for food and where to place the cutleries after eating.
