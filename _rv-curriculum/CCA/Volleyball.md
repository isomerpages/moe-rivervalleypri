Volleyball was formed in RV in 2004 and is one of the most popular sports CCAs in the school, with more than 100 members at its peak of popularity.

Besides learning ball-handling skills and techniques from our two professional coaches, our volleyball members also learn about **discipline, respect and teamwork** from the teachers and coaches. School team members gradually learn about **dedication and commitment**, as they find the balance between schoolwork and sports.  

All girls who are interested to learn volleyball are always welcome to sign up!
