<p>The RVPS Dance Ensemble is a 60-member focusing on international and street
dance. We strive to provide a supportive environment for inspiring young
dancers to develop their skills and character. During CCA sessions, students
learn a combination of different techniques such as Hip-Hop and jazz moves.
They also get a chance to perform in school events as well as external
competitions.</p>
<p>Through a holistic training programme by caring and patient instructors,
dancers learn important 21st&nbsp;century competencies such as self-awareness
and self-management. School-based dance performances usually encompass
the dance heritage of respective cultural contexts, allowing students to
develop cross-cultural skills.</p>
<p>Below are some events that the Dance Ensemble took part in:</p>
