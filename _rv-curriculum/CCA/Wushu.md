#### History of Wushu

  

Wushu is an exhibition as well as a full-contact sport derived from traditional Chinese martial arts. It was created&nbsp;in the&nbsp;_People's Republic of&nbsp;China_&nbsp;after 1949, in an attempt to nationalize the practice of traditional Chinese martial&nbsp;arts. Most of the modern competition forms were formed from their parent arts such as&nbsp;**少林拳**&nbsp;(_Shao Lin Quan_).

#### About RVPS Wushu

  

RVPS Wushu CCA was set up in 2008. The forty-five members then were just like any other ordinary students in school. However, they went through rigorous and physically - demanding trainings that they had not experienced before in their lives. Not only did the trainings help most of&nbsp;them to build up their physique, it had also made them&nbsp;mentally stronger than before.

#### Towards a Spirit of Excellence

  

Every year, members of RVPS Wushu School Team trained hard to prepare themselves for the&nbsp;_National School Games Wushu Competition (SPSSC)_. Participating in the national competition gave them many good takeaways such as treating their opponents with respect, the courage to perform in front of their opponents from other schools, and most importantly, not to give up easily but to take up the challenge to improve themselves despite not winning any medals.

In 2019, RVPS Wushu received an accolade at the&nbsp;_National School Games Wushu Competition 2019_.&nbsp;**_AATAVIUS KADEN NG_**&nbsp;of&nbsp;_P6 Friendship_&nbsp;attained&nbsp;**_8th&nbsp;for the 4 Duan Spear (Senior Boys) event_**.&nbsp;**_NG XIN HAN LEON_**&nbsp;of&nbsp;_P4 Confidence_&nbsp;achieved&nbsp;**_5th&nbsp;for the both Nanquan (Junior Boys) and Nan Dao (Junior Boys)_**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**_3rd&nbsp;for Nan Gun (Junior Boys) event_**.&nbsp;**_NG XIN KAI LEROY_**&nbsp;of&nbsp;_P6 Confidence_&nbsp;achieved&nbsp;_**4th&nbsp;place for Changquan (Senior Boys) event, 3rd&nbsp;of Broadsword (Senior Boys)**_&nbsp;and&nbsp;**_2nd&nbsp;place for Cudgel (Senior Boys) event_**.

#### An Avenue for Creativity

  

RVPS Wushu’s debut performance at the school’s&nbsp;_Speech Day_&nbsp;2009 impressed the audiences and there was an increase in student members in 2010.

Ever since RVPS Wushu debut performance at school’s Speech Day 2009, RVPS Wushu CCA participated actively in various school-based events and the wonderful performance left a deep impression on many of the students and attracted a lot of members every year. In 2018 and 2019, the chances to performance at school events have been extended to more junior members.

Our main objective is to increase sporting and performance opportunities for the young, especially those previously not involved in sports and hopefully to assist the participants to be healthier and develop holistically.&nbsp; Besides that, Wushu training in RVPS can help in the students’ character building, improving self-esteem and nurturing of life skills.
