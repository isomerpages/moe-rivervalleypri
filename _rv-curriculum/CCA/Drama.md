2023 has been a busy year for RV Drama Club.

The highlight of the year was coming in second for the annual International
Science Drama Competition (ISDC) organised by Science Centre
Singapore. Cherry Sim-Pan from 4 Graciousness won an Outstanding
Performer (Junior Category) award too.

In addition, a team took part in the Short Films category and was awarded
second as well as Best Videography and Cinematography Award.
The entries had to promote clean living and global concerns about
sustainability based on the theme of “Producing Green, Consuming Clean”.
This theme was aligned to the commemoration of the UN International Year
of Millets in 2023.

The main focus of the CCA is to develop the students’ confidence and skills
in acting. With continued effective training in voice projection, spatial
awareness and stage presence, the members also delighted the school
with mini skits for Total Defence Day, Racial Harmony Day, National Day,
Mid-Autumn Festival and RV Celebrates. The members enjoyed portraying
various characters to bring laughter and entertainment to their fellow
RVians.
