<h3>Chinese Talent Development Programme (TDP)</h3>
<p>The Chinese Talent Development Programme (TDP) aims to heighten RViansâ€™
interest in the Chinese Language by providing enriching out-of-classroom
experiences that build confidence and interest in language use. Anchored
in the MOE Mother Tongue Languages Primary Framework, this focuses on developing
language proficiency to the high ability studennts, building character,
and cultivating an appreciation for culture.</p>
<p>In Primary 4 TDP, students are guided through the analysis of selected
texts and trained in recital techniques to bring stories and characters
to life. This includes enhancing their vocal, emotional, and physical expressions,
fostering both linguistic and artistic confidence. Students also explore
creative writing by generating alternative endings for picture stories,
which promotes imagination, critical thinking, collaboration, and comprehension.
Platforms are provided for students to showcase their work, while selected
participants represent the school in the National Text Recital Competition.</p>
<p>In the Primary 5 TDP, selected students participate in a Song Lyrics Rewriting
Workshop, mentored by a renowned local songwriter. They learn key aspects
of lyric writing, including song structure, rhyming, and metaphor usage,
while working collaboratively to craft original lyrics. Students also get
to record their lyrics into songs. Through this process, they are empowered
to express their creativity and emotions through the Chinese Language in
meaningful and contemporary ways.</p>
<p>Together, these experiences nurture confident, expressive, and culturally
grounded students who are not only proficient in the language but also
passionate advocates for it.</p>
