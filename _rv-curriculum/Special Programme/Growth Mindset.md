<h3><strong>Growth Mindset Program - A Whole School Approach</strong></h3>
<p>In 2006, Dr Carol Dweck, a psychologist and researcher, found out a simple
but powerful theory that human intelligence, creativity and other qualities
are not fixed traits that we are born with. Rather, they are malleable
ones that with time and effort can be changed. Growth Mindset is the belief
that ability and intelligence can develop with effort and the right strategies.</p>
<p>In RVPS, we believe that Growth Mindset matters because it drives action.
It empowers students to recognize their capacity for change and take intentional
steps toward growth. We develop Growth Mindset in our students through
the school-wide 4Es approach, namely Equip, Enrich, Explore and Empower.</p>
<h4><strong>Equip</strong></h4>
<p>The Growth Mindset lessons teach students to identify Fixed Mindset and
reframe Fixed Mindset statements to Growth Mindset statements. Students
are also taught strategies and practices that they could use to foster
growth mindset.</p>
<h4><strong>Enrich</strong></h4>
<p>During pre-assembly, class lessons, learning journeys and CCA sessions,
Growth Mindset messages and practices are used to enrich students’ learning
on Growth Mindset. Through ample opportunities during in-class and out-of-class
sessions, we foster Growth Mindset and enrich students’ learning experiences.</p>
<h4><strong>Explore</strong></h4>
<p>Students are encouraged to reflect and explore on ways for improvement.
When faced with obstacles, students are encouraged to explore different
ways to overcome them. Students are encouraged to face challenges and mistakes
as opportunities for learning.</p>
<h4><strong>Empower</strong></h4>
<p>In RVPS, students learn that they are valued members of the community,
and they are empowered to contribute actively to their communities. Students
are empowered to share the Growth Mindset key messages with their peers
during pre-assembly and recess activities.</p>
