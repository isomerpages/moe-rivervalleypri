<h2>Student Leadership &amp; Community Involvement</h2>
<p></p>
<p>At River Valley Primary School, we believe that <strong>every pupil can lead and learn</strong>.
Through our LLP in Student Leadership &amp; Community Involvement, we empower
students with the knowledge, skills, and values to lead with confidence
and contribute meaningfully to society. Rooted in a student-centric and
values-driven education, our programme nurtures <strong>Empowered Thinkers</strong> and <strong>Transformational Leaders</strong> –
students who think critically, take initiative, and inspire positive change.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Core Programme Components</strong></h3>
<h4>1. Values Education Through CCE and School-based Lessons</h4>
<p>Our CCE syllabus focuses on core values, socio-emotional competencies,
and essential skills for character and citizenship development.&nbsp; Learning
is brought to life through scenario-based discussions and reflective activities
that help students connect their experiences to ethical decision-making.
Additionally, our termly school-based values lessons – centred on Respect,
Integrity, Compassion and Excellence – encourage students to apply their
learning in daily interactions, developing them into principled and empathetic
individuals.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>2.&nbsp;Values in Actions (VIA) Through Contribution to School and Society</h4>
<p>Our VIA programme progressively nurtures students’ sense of responsibility,
beginning with personal and school-based contributions before expanding
to broader community engagement:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

respect for peers.</p>

<p><strong>P5: Active Community Contributors </strong>– Students engage with
the elderly and individuals with different needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P6: #MakeADifference</strong> – Students research social issues,
brainstorm ways to engage target audience, and take purposeful action.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the classroom, CCA members leverage their talents and interests
to contribute meaningfully to the community, fostering social integration
and friendships across diverse groups.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>3.&nbsp;Leadership Development Through Experiential Learning in Camps</h4>
<p>Our level-wide Experiential Learning Camps (P3 – P5) extend learning beyond
the classroom, reinforcing the values of Harmony, Responsibility, and Resilience.
Students engage in hands-on challenges, teamwork activities, and personal
goal setting, equipping them with leadership skills and the confidence
to take initiative. Through reflection and guided facilitation, students
discover their strengths and areas for growth, fostering self-leadership
and collaboration.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>4.&nbsp;Transformational Leaders Through Leadership Programmes</h4>
<p>The <strong>Every RVian a Leader (ERaL)</strong> programme ensures that
every student takes on a leadership role, fostering a culture of responsible
and values-driven leadership. Our approach is shaped by four key attributes:</p>
<p>(a) <strong>Inclusive Leadership:</strong> Every student has the potential
to lead and make an impact.</p>
<p>(b) <strong>Values-Driven &amp; Resilient Leadership: </strong>Students
take ownership of their choices, demonstrate resilience, and adapt to challenges.</p>
<p>(c) <strong>Emotional Intelligence &amp; Team Engagement: </strong>They
communicate effectively, inspire others, and foster collaboration.</p>
<p>(d) <strong>Advocacy &amp; Social Responsibility:</strong> They champion
meaningful causes, advocate for change, and contribute to building a better
society.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At RVPS, leadership is not about position – it is about action. Our students
are equipped to think critically, lead with integrity, and make lasting
difference in their communities. Together, we shape <strong>Empowered Thinkers </strong>and <strong>Transformational Leaders</strong> who
are ready to build a future with clarity, confidence, and compassion.</p>
