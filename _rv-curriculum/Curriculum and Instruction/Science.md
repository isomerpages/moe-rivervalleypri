<h3>Department Vision</h3>
<p>We nurture curious, self-regulated learners who think critically, communicate
confidently, and apply scientific inquiry to explore the world and solve
real-world problems.</p>
<h3>Our curricular approach</h3>
<p>We empower every student to explore, understand, and contribute meaningfully
to the world through Science. Students learn Science based on five key
themes that reflect real-world phenomena. These themes—Diversity, Cycles,
Systems, Energy, and Interactions—span both life and physical sciences,
offering a strong foundation for deeper learning. Our goal is to nurture
every RVian to be curious, confident, and collaborative— equipped with
the knowledge, skills, and values to explore the world like young scientists.</p>
<h4>Inquiry-based Learning</h4>
<p>Science is taught using an Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) approach. Students
learn through hands-on activities, discussions, and exploration, making
Science fun, engaging, and meaningful. Using a spiral approach, key concepts
and skills are revisited at deeper levels over time, supporting students’
thinking and long-term understanding. Guided by essential questions, students
make connections across topics and develop critical thinking skills.</p>

<h3><strong>Talent Development Programmes</strong></h3>
<h4>P5 E2K Science</h4>
<p>Our E2K Science Programme for Primary 5 students is designed to ignite
curiosity and inspire deeper scientific thinking through an inquiry-based
learning approach. This enrichment programme provides opportunities for
students to actively engage in hands-on investigations and explore advanced
science concepts beyond the classroom curriculum. Through collaborative
exploration and problem-solving, students develop essential 21st-century
competencies such as critical and inventive thinking, as well as effective
communication skills. Participation is by invitation, extended to students
who demonstrate a strong aptitude and interest in Science. Selected students
attend weekly 1.5-hour sessions over the course of 8 to 10 weeks.</p>
<h4>P4 STEM (Math and Science)</h4>
<p>Through a series of hands-on, student-led initiatives, our students apply
Design Thinking to transform school green spaces into vibrant, sustainable
environments. From crafting upcycled art installations and designing eco-friendly
structures to curating themed gardens and developing educational eco-trails,
students blend creativity with environmental consciousness. Workshops with
industry experts, collaboration with artists and scientists, and real-world
challenges empower them to innovate with purpose. Participation in this
after school programme is by invitation and offered to students who demonstrate
strong aptitude and interest in Mathematics and Science.</p>

<h3><strong>Every RVian a Leader</strong></h3>
<h4>Science and Environment Advocates (SEAs)</h4>
<p>As part of our commitment to nurturing confident and responsible leaders,
our Every RVian a Leader programme empowers students to develop and refine
their leadership skills through hands-on, meaningful experiences. Our SEAs
work towards completing their Leadership Passports by taking on a variety
of environmental and science-related responsibilities. These include presenting
on science topics they are passionate about—encouraging curiosity, public
speaking, and peer learning. They take ownership of maintaining their class’
Bloobox recycling system, promoting sustainability and environmental stewardship
to their peers.</p>

<h4><strong>E.C.O. Spark Lab (Upcycling Makerspace)</strong></h4>
<p>At River Valley Primary School, the E.C.O. Spark Lab is more than just
a creative corner—it's a testament to student voice, sustainability, and
innovation in action. The makerspace was born out of a student-initiated
project in 2024, sparked by the idea of transforming old school uniforms
into useful items. With strong student advocacy, support from school leaders,
and a partnership with The Circular Classroom, a dedicated space was created
to support sustainable design and hands-on learning. Today, the E.C.O.
Spark Lab is actively used for student-led upcycling projects and is integrated
into the Science and Art curriculum—where students explore materials, environmental
impact, and creative reuse. During recess, the space also hosts a vibrant
student program where learners use recycled materials to design creative
solutions to real-world sustainability challenges, applying critical, adaptive,
and inventive thinking skills. It serves as a hub for innovation, community
engagement, and a growing culture of sustainability across the school.</p>
