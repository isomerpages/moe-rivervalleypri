**Inquiry-based Learning (IBL) Approach**

Science teachers in River Valley Primary School use an Inquiry-based Learning approach to help students learn Science.  Every RVian learn Science in fun and interesting ways, and is curious and inquisitive about things around them.  In an IBL Science class in RVPS, Science teachers aim to **Equip** all RVians with Knowledge, Skills and Values through student exploration, discussions, and collaborating via hands-on activities.

Besides developing and applying their cognitive understanding, RVians are also **Empowered** to actualize the school values of Respect (how they should listen when their friend is explaining), Integrity (having the moral courage to speak up when their peers are not doing the right thing), Compassion (care for the environment and biodiversity by using recycled materials in their science lessons) and Excellence (being passionate and taking ownership of their learning).

**Powered By Discovery programme**

The Powered By Discovery programme helps to nurture students’ passion for learning in Science and promote critical thinking. Students worked collaboratively on a Science inquiry project. Through research, students deepened knowledge in a topic of interest. They then worked together to justify their reasoning and create a product. Platforms are provided for students to showcase their learning and product. This promotes ownership and co-creation of learning in Science. 

Here is some feedback from our students:

Demonstrations are teacher-centric and promote scaffolding when students acquire Science concepts and can lead to student experimentation.  Experimentation - students doing hands-on activities, **Enrich**es students by providing them with opportunities to observe Science phenomena with the use of Science apparatus.

### P6 Science Booster
------------------

To motivate the P6 students in their learning, the students were given the autonomy to choose the areas which they needed more help and support from Science teachers. 

A strategy that students learn is the skill of note-taking in Science language to help with self revision and team learning.  Students learn to create mindmaps, design concept maps and make visually-colourful annotations to help them retain scientific knowledge.

Students also make linkages between concepts so that they make connections across the various topics.  Their works of the students are also displayed to encourage their peers learn from one another. 

Feedback from the students have been positive as they enjoyed making their learning meaningful and sharing their notes with their peers.

### Modular Programme
-----------------

The P1 and 2 Science Modular Programme aims to Empower our P1 and P2 students to be curious and be keen observers about the world around them.

In this programme, the students will be doing basic investigative work to explore Science phenomena. 

They will also discuss and collaborate with their friends and co-create knowledge with their peers and their teachers.

By inculcating a Joy of Learning Science at an early age, the students will be imbued with the relevant values and dispositions. 

These become a strong foundation for our students when they learn Science from Primary 3.
