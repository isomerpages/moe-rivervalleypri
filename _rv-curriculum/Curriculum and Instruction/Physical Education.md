<h2>Physical Education </h2>
<p>At River Valley Primary School, Physical Education (PE) is more than just
exercise and games — it is about nurturing healthy, confident, and resilient
learners.</p>
<p>Through a carefully planned programme, students not only build strong
physical skills but also develop critical life skills like teamwork, leadership,
perseverance, and responsibility.</p>
<p>We believe every child can be a confident mover, thoughtful leader, and
active contributor to the community.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Our RVPS PE Curriculum Journey</h3>
<p>We tailor our PE experiences based on the students’ developmental stages:</p>
<h4>Lower Primary (Primary 1 &amp; 2) — Building Strong Foundations</h4>
<p><strong>Developing Fundamental Movement Skills:</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are taught how to run, jump, throw, balance, and move confidently.
These are the building blocks for all future sports and activities.</p>
<p><strong>Learning through Fun and Play:</strong>
</p>
<p>Lessons include games, dance, gymnastics, and simple challenges. Students
explore how to move their bodies safely and creatively, while learning
about personal space, teamwork, and equipment use.</p>
<p><strong>Building Confidence:</strong>
</p>
<p>Activities are structured to encourage success for every child, boosting
self-esteem and enjoyment in being physically active.</p>
<h4>Middle Primary (Primary 3 &amp; 4) — Strengthening Skills and Independence</h4>
<p><strong>Applying and Combining Skills:</strong>
</p>
<p>Students learn to apply basic movement skills into games, team activities,
and small group challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Game Concepts:</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are taught how to play simple games using strategies like working
with teammates and making decisions during play.</p>
<p><strong>Blended Learning in PE:</strong>
</p>
<p>Lessons combine hands-on practice with digital platforms (like the Student
Learning Space) for students to review skills at their own pace, watch
demonstration videos, and reflect on their performance.</p>
<p><strong>Developing Personal Responsibility:</strong>
</p>
<p>Students set goals, reflect on their learning, and learn how to practise
safely and independently.</p>
<h4>Upper Primary (Primary 5 &amp; 6) — Leadership, Strategy, and Lifelong Skills</h4>
<p><strong>Authentic Sport Experiences:</strong>
</p>
<p>Using the Sports Education Model (SEM), students experience what it’s
like to be players, referees, and team managers in sport settings.</p>
<p><strong>Learning through Games:</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are taught how to think tactically in games — planning strategies,
making quick decisions, and working closely with teammates.</p>
<p><strong>Character Building:</strong>
</p>
<p>Students learn sportsmanship, fair play, resilience when facing challenges,
and respect for others.</p>
<p><strong>Preparing for Active Living Beyond School:</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to find joy in movement and understand the importance
of staying active for life.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Key Features of Our RVPS PE Programme</h3>
<h4>1. Growth Mindset Development</h4>
<p>We teach students that <strong>effort and perseverance matter more than winning</strong>.</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to celebrate small improvements, learn from mistakes,
and keep trying even when challenges arise.</p>
<h4>2. Critical Thinking and Reflection</h4>
<p>Students are guided to think about their movements and decisions using
simple strategies:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>What went well?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What could I improve?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What can I try differently next time?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thinking routines like "See-Think-Wonder" and "Think-Pair-Share" are part
of every PE experience.</p>
<h4>3. Values Education through PE</h4>
<p>PE lessons intentionally reinforce important values:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

</li>

</ul>
<p>Students are taught to apply the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and
our school values throughout their physical activities.</p>
<h4>4. Quality Assessment and Feedback</h4>
<p>We assess students in ways that help them grow, not just "test" them:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Teachers observe students during activities and give real-time encouragement
and coaching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students set personal physical goals and track their progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflection and feedback cycles help students understand how they can improve
themselves.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Reports are shared with parents twice a year, highlighting both skill
development and learning behaviours.</p>
<h4>5. Technology in PE</h4>
<p>We harness technology to enhance learning:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Videos and Demonstrations: Students watch and learn techniques before
trying them out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performance Review: Students may record their own movements to reflect
and improve.</p>

<p>Home Challenges: Fun online fitness activities encourage students to stay
active outside school hours.</p>

and responsibly even in PE contexts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Our Commitment to Parents and Community</h3>

<p><strong>Communication:</strong>
</p>
<p>Parents receive updates through Parents Gateway about PE activities, student
progress, and ways to encourage active lifestyles at home.</p>
<p><strong>Partnerships:</strong>
</p>
<p>We collaborate with community partners to offer students enriched sports
learning experiences, workshops, and active lifestyle campaigns.</p>
<p>Together, we build a strong support system around every child to promote
a lifetime of healthy living and personal excellence.</p>
