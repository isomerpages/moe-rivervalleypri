### **The RV PE Curriculum**

The PE Department plans our curriculum in line with MOE’s objectives as well as the school’s strategic objectives for our students.

In the lower primary, we focus on fundamental movement skills and use the spiral approach whereby we constantly provide opportunities for students to practice the skills that are taught and allow them to master the skills over time. In the upper primary, the focus shifts to teaching students games concepts so that they understand how to apply the skills they have been taught in various game situations. We also continue the spiral approach by helping students refine their skills.

By aligning our department’s outcomes to the national PE syllabus, we plan the Swimming Programme for our Primary 3 students during curriculum time. The programme, conducted by qualified swim coaches, teaches our students swimming skills as well as basic life-saving skills. Upon completion of the SwimSafer programme, students are awarded the SwimSafer certification supported by Sport Singapore. This certification is recognized nation-wide, hence students can progress to higher level of certification on their own externally.

### **Assessment for Learning in PE**
---------------------------------

Formative assessment is an on-going process across the levels for all students. PE teachers introduce Peer and Self-Assessment in the teaching and learning of PE, as well as facilitate reflections in various forms to monitor student learning. These assessment modes give students greater ownership in their learning. Through the assessment tasks, students develop greater awareness of themselves and develop social skills as they get to interact with and help their peers make progress.

The PE Department infuses the use of ICT in our teaching and learning of PE. The students have the opportunity to use tablets for video recording and evaluation of their skill performances during their formative assessment. There are also opportunities to allow them to document their progress and review on the performances. Students use visible thinking routines to deppen their critical thinking in PE.

#### **Partnership with our Stakeholders**

Our school is very honoured to be one of the selected primary schools in Singapore to partner PE and Sports Teachers Academy (PESTA) and Physical, Sports and Outdoor Education Branch (PSOEB) to embark on the enhancement of our PE curriculum through new interventions in PE. We also have the privilege of hosting several overseas Visiting Fellows who are PE professionals, whereby our teachers engage in enriching classroom observations and discussions with them.

##### **21 st Century Competencies through PE**

PE is an integral part of the total curriculum in RVPS, hence it plays a huge role in fostering the development of the 21st Century Competencies (21CC) and its associated desired student outcomes.

Through the school values of Respect, Integrity, Compassion and Excellence (RICE), PE lessons are accompanied with a value themed for each term. Students develop Social Emotional Competencies and emerging 21CC by experiencing PE lessons which enhances such experiences as part of their weekly lessons. The school also incorporated the learning on the selected leadership qualities through behavioral indicators identified and to be displayed during PE lessons. At the end of each semester, students will then receive a Leadership Qualities (LQ) Report as a feedback on their observable behaviour during the lessons and the areas for improvement.

We aim not only to develop each student to possess a healthy mind and body with a zest for life, but to also possess a good sense of self-awareness, a sound moral compass, and the necessary skills and knowledge to take on future challenges; responsible to his/her family, community and nation.

#### **Beyond the Classroom**

RVPS has a wide array of events and programmes for our students. Our highlight is the Annual Sports Carnival which expose students to a variety of activities. It is a great platform for students to display camaraderie as they compete to win the most number of points to claim the Champion House trophy.

In line with our school’s Learning for Life (LLP) programme, we customise our level-wide camps to bring out the learning of the School Values in our students. With experiential learning as the foundation, each Level Camp has a value attached to it, inculcating the value in our students throughout the camp. For Primary 3 students, we have Camp Harmony whereby students learn the value of teamwork as well as empathy. Our Primary 4 students go through Camp Responsibility in which they learn the value of responsibility, from being responsible of their own belongings to being responsible of their own safety during the camp. As for the Primary 5 students, they undergo Camp Resilience, a 3-day-2-night adventure camp. Through the different activities during the camp, students strengthen their resilience and learn not to give up when faced with challenges. The experiences from these three level camps toughen our students’ mind and teach them valuable lessons outside the classrooms, and prepare them to be Future-Ready.
