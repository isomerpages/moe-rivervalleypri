<p>At River Valley Primary School, we believe that a well-rounded Aesthetics education plays a vital role in nurturing creativity and self-expression in every child.</p>

<p>The Aesthetics curriculum is an integral part of our holistic approach to learning, enriching students' experiences and fostering a lifelong appreciation for the arts. Through our Aesthetics Education, every RVian will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Develop a deep appreciation and love for the arts</li>
  <li>Discover and nurture their artistic interests and talents</li>
  <li>Express themselves creatively through various artistic forms</li>
</ul>

<p>By engaging in meaningful artistic experiences, our students gain confidence, imagination, and a broader perspective of the world around them.</p>

<p><strong>Key Programmes</strong></p>
<p>The school adopts the E3 approach to ensure that our arts programme provides structured and diverse arts experiences for all RVians.</p>
