</li>
</ol>
<h3>Key Programmes</h3>
<h4>Mother Tongue Language Fortnight</h4>
<p>The two-week Mother Tongue Language Fortnight aimed to integrate language
learning with cultural rediscovery through fun and meaningful experiences.
Students were engaged in a variety of activities rooted in different cultures,
nurturing their cross-cultural literacy and appreciation for linguistic
diversity.</p>
<p>Through these activities, students not only enhanced their language skills
in their respective Mother Tongue Languages but also deepened their understanding
of various cultural perspectives, customs, and traditions, while developing
compassion, respect, and sensitivity towards people from diverse backgrounds.</p>
<h4>Festival Celebration</h4>
<p>In RV, we celebrate Chinese New Year, Mid-Autumn Celebration, Hari Raya
Aidilfitri, and Deepavali to promote cultural appreciation and unity among
students. Through engaging activities such as traditional performances,
craft-making, and festive storytelling, students gain insights into the
unique customs and values of each ethnic community. These celebrations
foster respect for diversity, intercultural understanding, and collaborative
skills, aligning with our goal of nurturing 21st Century Competencies (21CC)
such as global awareness, communication, and civic literacy.</p>
<h4>Reading Programme @ RV</h4>
<p>The Reading Programme @ RV aims to inspire Rivians to cultivate a lifelong
love for reading Mother Tongue Language (MTL) books. It encourages students
to read for both enjoyment and knowledge acquisition, while also enhancing
their language proficiency.</p>
<p>To support the development of comprehension and communication skills,
the programme integrates a variety of Thinking Routines. These routines
guide students to think deeply about the texts they read and express their
ideas more clearly and confidently during discussions and sharing sessions.</p>
<p>Collectively, these initiatives aim to build a vibrant and inclusive reading
culture at RV, where students are empowered to read with purpose, think
critically, and communicate effectively in their Mother Tongue Languages.</p>
<p>(i) Lower Primary Guided Reading Programme</p>
<p>To nurture early reading habits, 30 minutes of MTL curriculum time is
set aside weekly for Lower Primary students. During this time, students
engage in guided reading and library-based activities. This structured
exposure helps to instil positive reading habits from a young age and enhances
their MTL language skills through regular practice.</p>
<p>(ii) 故事爸爸妈妈 (Storytelling by Dads and Mums)</p>
<p>Once a month, during recess, parents of Primary 1 to 4 students are invited
to the library to share Chinese stories with students. This initiative
strengthens school–home partnerships and fosters a supportive reading culture
by encouraging parental involvement in students’ language development.</p>
<p>(iii) Thursday Tales – MTL Story Sharing</p>
<p>During even week of Thursday morning assemblies, selected Rvians take
on the role of storytellers by introducing and reciting engaging MTL stories
to their peers. This platform empowers students to share their favourite
stories, build confidence in oral communication, and develop a deeper appreciation
for MTL literature.</p>
<h4>MTL Cultural Camp and MTL Theatre Experience</h4>
<p>Our MTL Cultural Camp and Theatre Experience programme offers meaningful
opportunities for Rvians to explore the MTL culture in an engaging and
immersive environment. Through a blend of hands-on activities and live
performances, the programme aims to deepen students’ appreciation of their
Mother Tongue Language (MTL) and its cultural roots.</p>
<h4>Chinese Textbook Recital Competition</h4>
<p>Class recital competitions are held for all Primary 1 and 2 students,
while selected students from Primary 3 to 5 take part in the National Text
Recital Competition. These competitions aim to strengthen students’ Chinese
language skills, especially reading and appreciation of Chinese texts from
their textbooks. They also inspire a love for the language. Beyond language
skills, the competitions help students build confidence and speak clearly,
boosting their communication abilities and self-esteem.</p>
<h4>Chinese Speech and Drama</h4>
<p>The Speech &amp; Drama Course is specially designed based on the MOE Chinese
syllabus from 欢乐伙伴 and integrated into the Primary 2 Chinese curriculum.
It aims to nurture confident and articulate speakers by helping Rivians
develop key skills in storytelling, poetry recitation, and acting. Through
this engaging course, students also strengthen their creativity, communication,
and collaboration—essential 21st Century Competencies (21CC). The programme
culminates in a short musical performance for Primary 1 students, providing
an authentic platform for students to showcase their talents and build
self-confidence.</p>
