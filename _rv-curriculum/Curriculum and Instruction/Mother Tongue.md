**Department Vision**  

To nurture passion in learning Mother Tongue Languages and cultures and empower our students to be effective communicators.

**Our Curricular Approach**

The teaching and learning of Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) in River Valley Primary School is anchored on MOE’s objectives of developing proficient language users from three perspectives – Communication, Culture and Connection, guided by the RVian pedagogical framework of “Equip” ”Empower” ”Explore” and “Enrich”.

To equip our students with the necessary language skills in view of the needs of the local language context, students’ language skills are built up progressively from the lower primary levels with oracy paving the way for acquisition of reading and writing skills, while for the upper primary, there is increased focus on reading and writing which will in turn, enrich the students’ oracy skills.  There is also emphasis on interactive skills so that students are empowered to communicate and connect with others effectively. 

The MTL curriculum is structured in a thematic style that facilitates the exploration of the use of MTL in connection with situations in everyday life, from the personal level to wider perspectives such as environmental issues and progress of human in history. 

Recognising that our students come from homes with highly varied language backgrounds, our MTL classes focus on engaging and interactive pedagogy that is facilitated by customisation and varied means of assessment to cater to the different needs of students.  Programmes are designed to target their learning needs as well as enrich their awareness of and appreciation for culture.
