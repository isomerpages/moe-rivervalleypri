#### Cyber Wellness

The MOE Cyber Wellness framework is used to develop the RVian’s instinct to protect and empower them to take responsibility for their own well-being in cyberspace. The three principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’ when adhered to will anchor a child’s well-being in cyberspace as he will then be able to make careful and well-considered decisions.

In RV, students are equipped with knowledge of Cyber Wellness through FTGP lessons, termly sharing during morning assembly by Cyber Wellness Coordinator, Cyber Wellness corner in classrooms and sharing of Cyber Wellness knowledge by Cyber Wellness Ambassadors.

In conjunction with the Safer Internet Day, the Cyber Wellness Day is held to raise students’ awareness of Cyber Wellness through interesting hands on activities.
