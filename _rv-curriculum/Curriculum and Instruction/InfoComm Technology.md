#### Cyber Wellness

The MOE Cyber Wellness framework is used to develop the RVian’s instinct to protect and empower them to take responsibility for their own well-being in cyberspace. The three principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’ when adhered to will anchor a child’s well-being in cyberspace as he will then be able to make careful and well-considered decisions.

In RV, students are equipped with knowledge of Cyber Wellness through FTGP lessons, termly sharing during morning assembly by Cyber Wellness Coordinator, Cyber Wellness corner in classrooms and sharing of Cyber Wellness knowledge by Cyber Wellness Ambassadors.

In conjunction with the Safer Internet Day, the Cyber Wellness Day is held to raise students’ awareness of Cyber Wellness through interesting hands on activities.

#### Infusion of Baseline ICT Standards into subjects

MOE developed a set of baseline ICT standards which consist of core ICT skills that are essential to support engaged learning by students and to prepare them for the future. These standards are integrated into subjects such as English, Mother Tongue, Mathematics and Science to ensure that no student is left behind in terms of his or her ability to benefit from an ICT-enabled learning environment. Students learn basic Touch Typing, fundamentals of Microsoft Word, PowerPoint and Excel as well as New Media Literacies from Primary 1 to 5.

#### Modular Programme (ICT)

Coding enhances students’ computational thinking (the ability to express thoughts in a rational and sequenced way) and facilitates creativity as there are endless variations and solutions of coding. In the ICT module, Primary 1 and 2 students learn coding using the Scratch programme. At the end of the programme, students will be able to do simple coding by themselves. Differentiated learning is provided for students who have had prior experience in coding. (pictures taken before Covid-19)
