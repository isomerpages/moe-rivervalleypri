<h3>Empowered Voices: Communicate with Confidence, Purpose, and Heart</h3>
<p>At River Valley Primary School (RVPS), the EL Department is committed
to nurturing thinkers and leaders who communicate with confidence, purpose,
and heart. Aligned with our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) outcomes and
the strategic thrust of “Nurturing Thinkers and Leaders”, we empower students
to use language effectively and empathetically — not only to express themselves
but also to advocate for the good of their community.</p>
<p>By fostering Active Learning, Curiosity, Critical Thinking, and Team Learning,
we create a opportunities for students to listen, read, and view content
with an open mind, engage in discussions, and collaborate in knowledge-building.
Through oracy lessons and application of thinking routines, students learn
to ask questions, articulate ideas clearly, and develop a strong sense
of social responsibility.</p>
<p>With language as a powerful tool, we guide students in understanding diverse
perspectives, honing their communication skills, and becoming self-directed
learners. By anchoring learning in values and real-world connections, we
aspire to cultivate confident communicators and adaptive leaders who will
make a meaningful impact.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Cultivating Critical Thinkers Through Thinking Routines</h3>
<p>Thinking Routines are integral to our teaching and learning strategies,
helping students develop critical thinking, reasoning, and idea-generation
skills. This approach encourages them to explore ideas, make connections,
and synthesise information, making them more reflective and adaptable learners.</p>
<p>For instance, See-Think-Wonder (STW) and See-Think-Wonder-Connect (STWC)
are used to develop observation skills, encourage predictions, and generate
ideas for writing. Similarly, Know-Want to Know-Learned (KWL) stimulates
curiosity and engagement with information texts. To deepen comprehension,
Claim-Support-Question (CSQ) guides students to justify their interpretations
with evidence, while Colour-Symbol-Image (CSI) helps them distil complex
ideas visually.</p>
<p>By embedding these routines, we empower students to think critically,
communicate effectively, and approach learning with curiosity and confidence.</p>
<h3>The Reading Programme – Thursday Tales</h3>
<p>At RVPS, we believe that reading enriches minds, builds confidence, and
fosters a lifelong love for language. Thursday Tales is a platform where
students share stories with their peers, making reading an engaging and
communal experience.</p>
<p>On scheduled Thursdays, students take the stage in the morning to read
aloud stories or excerpts in the School Hall. Additionally, pre-recorded
readings are played in the School Library during recess, ensuring accessibility
for all. By placing students at the heart of storytelling, we cultivate
a vibrant reading culture beyond the classroom.</p>
<h3>English Language Week: Celebrating the Joy of Language</h3>
<p>English Language Week is a highlight of the school year, bringing the
English language to life through immersive activities. With a unique theme
each year, students participate in interactive assembly programmes, hands-on
class activities, and recess engagements, all designed to deepen their
appreciation for language and storytelling.</p>
<p>A key feature of the week is Characters Come Alive Day, where students
and staff dress as their favourite storybook characters, transforming the
school into a literary wonderland. This experience ignites excitement for
reading and reinforces the power of stories in shaping imagination and
learning.</p>
