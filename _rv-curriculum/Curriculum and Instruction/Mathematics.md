**Department Vision**

To nurture RVians’ love of Mathematics, translating their efforts into competencies and confidence, and equipping them with strong critical problem solving skills.

**Department Mission**

To create a vibrant, joyful and positive learning environment for students to cultivate their love for the subject and to become skilful problem solvers.

### Teaching and Learning
---------------------

#### **(A) Three Key Approaches**

**(i) Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract Approach**

Math is taught using the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract Approach (commonly referred to as CPA approach). Use of Concrete materials includes manipulatives such as counters, measuring tools or other objects that the students can handle during the lessons.

Pictorial representations include models, drawings, diagrams, charts or graphs that are drawn by the students or are provided for the students to read and interpret. Abstract refers to symbolic representations such as numbers or letters that the student writes or interprets to demonstrate understanding of a task. The lessons are designed using the C-P-A sequence and Mathematics learning becomes deeper as students transcend from one level to another. Such an approach benefits all students, and has proven to be effective in the foundation years or when students are introduced to a new topic.

**(ii) Embedding Heuristics in Problem Sums**

The teaching of heuristics is essential for mathematical problem solving. As such, RVians are given opportunities to solve problems using a repertoire of heuristics progressively. With practice, students should be able to apply the heuristics that they have learnt to solve problems independently. Beyond personal practice, students will deepen their mastery through discussions and provide explanations of their reasoning.

**(iii) Challenging students through Making Thinking Visible Routines (MTV)**

To grow our students into stronger critical thinkers and to deepen their understanding, Math teachers will make use of thinking routines to guide students’ thinking and allow them to articulate and to present their thinking. Teachers also make use of intellectual standards of critical thinking such as Accuracy and Clarity to sharpen students’ responses and enable them to pick up the skills to present their solutions for solving problems.

#### Promoting Joy of Learning in Math
---------------------------------

![](/images/RV%20Curriculum/Curriculum%20and%20Instructions/Mathematics/2pic.jpg)

Fostering Joy of Learning in Math is an important focus in the learning of Mathematics. Over and above the importance of learning of skills and concepts, it is equally important for students to find joy in the learning of Math. To engender this outcome, the Math department aspires in designing learning experiences that ignite excitement, encourage students to be inquisitive and to discover answers on their own.

**(i)**  **Integrated Learning Math Programme (Primary 3 Math)**

The programme provides a platform to promote joy and passion for learning as the P3 students are given the autonomy to showcase their projects in different mediums. It enhances their leadership skills as students take lead and ownership to design their project. It promotes deep thinking as students do their own research to find the relevance and connection for their projects and make the learning of Mathematics more relatable and applicable to their everyday lives. The students explore how fractions can be used in different occupations and various aspects in their daily lives.

**(ii) Modular Mathematics Programme (Primary 2)**

The P2 Math Modular Programme seeks to bring joy of learning into the mathematics classrooms of our precious Primary 2 students. Believing strongly that “Math is Fun and Math is Everywhere”, the Math department designs lesson packages that enrich students’ learning of Math.

From the exploration of mathematical manipulatives to bringing Math out of the classroom to making application of Math in real-life situations, students will be given opportunities to enjoy, learn and use Math in interactive ways. During the three-period lesson, students are given different tasks and activities that stretch their thinking and creativity, enable them to work collaboratively as a team, allow them to make mathematical communication and connection, experience how positive attitudes and values can be displayed through problem solving and finding excitement in the learning of Math. At the end of the programme, we hope to evoke the passion of Math among our young RVians.
