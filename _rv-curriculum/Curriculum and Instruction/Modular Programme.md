<h3><strong>Modular Programme (MP): Building Future-Ready Learners</strong></h3>
<p>At River Valley Primary School, our Modular Programme (MP) is designed
to equip students with essential 21st-century competencies, preparing them
for an evolving and technology-driven future. The programme focuses on
two key areas – Information &amp; Communication Technology (ICT) and Executive
Functioning Skills (EFS) with 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. <strong>Information &amp; Communication Technology (ICT) and Executive Functioning Skills (EFS) with 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.&nbsp;</strong>Through
engaging and structured learning experiences, students develop digital
literacy, life skills, and leadership qualities that empower them to thrive
in today’s world.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>ICT MP: Building Digital Competencies</strong></h4>
<p>The ICT MP nurtures foundational IT skills while fostering critical thinking
and problem-solving abilities. Aligned with the Digital Learning and Teaching
Skills (DLTS) framework, the programme covers:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Device and Software Operations</strong> – Developing confidence
in using digital tools for learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Digital Safety and Security</strong> - Understanding of online
behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself in the online space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Coding and Programming</strong> – Introducing computational concepts
through fun, age-appropriate platforms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Progression of Learning</h4>
<p>The ICT programme offers Primary 1 and 2 students the key digital skills
needed for future coding experiences.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Primary 1:</strong> Students explore iPads and engage in block-based
programming using ScratchJr, developing computational thinking through
creative, interactive projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Primary 2</strong>: Students will add on to the skills learned
from P1 to move on and advance from ScratchJr to Scratch3.0.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This structured approach prepares students for the Code for Fun and AI
for Fun programme in Primary 5 and 6, ensuring they are ready for a digitally-driven
world.</p>

<h4><strong>EFS &amp; 7 Habits: Developing Life Skills for Success</strong></h4>
<p>EFS are mental processes that help students plan, focus, remember instructions,
and manage multiple tasks effectively. Often described as the brain’s “air
traffic control system”, these skills are crucial for academic success
and personal development.</p>
<p>At RVPS, we complement EFS with the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,
cultivating positive habits and self-leadership from an early age. The
focus areas for each level include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Primary 1: Private Victory (Self-Leadership &amp; Independence)</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>EFS Focus: Planning &amp; Organisation, Self-Monitoring, and Working Memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>7 Habits: Be Proactive, Begin with the End in Mind, Put First Things First,
and Sharpen the Saw.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Primary 2: Public Victory (Social Awareness &amp; Collaboration)</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>EFS Focus: Emotional Control and Inhibition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>7 Habits: Think Win-Win, Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood,
Synergise, and Sharpen the Saw.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through engaging activities and reflections, students cultivate resilience,
self-awareness, and interpersonal skills that support their academic and
personal growth.</p>
<h3><strong>Shaping Future-Ready Learners</strong></h3>
<p>At RVPS, the MP is more than just a curriculum – it’s a pathway to becoming
future-ready learners. By integrating digital skills, executive functioning,
and leadership principles, we empower students to think critically, act
responsibly, and navigate challenges with confidence. We are committed
to nurturing innovative, self-driven learners who are ready to lead – both
in school and beyond.</p>
