<h3><strong>English Language Talent Development Programme (EL TDP)</strong></h3>
<p>At River Valley Primary School (RVPS), the English Language Talent Development
Programme (EL TDP) aims to nurture students into confident and empathetic
communicators in both writing and speech. Through this programme, students
not only develop a sensitivity to and appreciation for the power of language
but are also empowered to use language effectively and meaningfully.</p>
<p>Beyond honing their communication skills, we envision our students using
their voices to advocate for change and make a positive impact on their
community.</p>
<h4><strong>Exploring Language Through Literature</strong></h4>
<p>In Primary 4, students delve into the world of literary texts, such as
poetry, to explore deeper themes and ideas. Through discussions and debates,
they engage in critical thinking and develop their ability to articulate
perspectives with clarity.</p>
<p>Additionally, students are encouraged to exercise their creativity in
writing, experimenting with forms such as shape poetry. They also get the
opportunity to share their crafted pieces with their peers, building confidence
in expressing their ideas to an audience.</p>
<h4><strong>Advocating for a Cause</strong></h4>
<p>In Primary 5, students take their language skills beyond the classroom
by selecting a cause they are passionate about and working towards making
a difference in their community. Through this meaningful endeavour, they
learn to apply persuasive writing and speaking techniques to advocate for
their chosen cause.</p>
<p>This hands-on experience allows students to see the real-world impact
of purposeful and responsible communication, reinforcing the idea that
age is not a barrier to making a difference.</p>
<h4><strong>Empowering Voices for a Better Tomorrow</strong></h4>
<p>Through the EL TDP, we hope for RVians to develop the skills, confidence,
and empathy needed to use language as a powerful tool for change. By equipping
them with opportunities to think critically, express creatively, and advocate
meaningfully, we empower them to become thoughtful and responsible communicators
who contribute to a better world.</p>
