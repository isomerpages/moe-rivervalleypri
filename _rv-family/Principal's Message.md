<p>It has been a privilege to serve as the Principal of River Valley Primary
School (RVPS) for the past two years. During this time, we have continued
to build on the strong foundation laid by my predecessors and our dedicated
teachers, fostering a school environment that nurtures every childâ€™s potential
and prepares them for the future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Education at RVPS extends beyond academic excellence; it is about shaping
character, fostering curiosity, and instilling a growth mindset. To better
reflect the evolving competencies and dispositions our students need to
thrive in an ever-changing world, we have refreshed our school vision from <em>Inspiring Learners, Edifying Leaders to Empowered Thinkers</em>;
Transformational Leaders. This shift underscores our commitment to developing
students who think critically, lead with purpose, and adapt confidently
to challenges.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We have also enhanced our learning environment. Our refreshed pillars
now showcase The <em>7 Habits of Highly Effective People and Growth Mindset</em>,
reinforcing the values and attitudes essential for lifelong success. The
newly designed learning corridor provides a space for students to express
their voices, exchange ideas, and inspire one another.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As we move forward, we aspire for every RVian to embody the following
qualities: critical thinking, adaptability, and a growth mindset. RVians
will confidently navigate complexities, distinguish fact from misinformation,
and make informed decisions. They will embrace diversity, communicate effectively,
and lead through action, fostering meaningful change within their communities.
Anchored in strong values, they will demonstrate resilience, take ownership
of their actions, and inspire innovation to build a better future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As Nelson Mandela once said, <em>"Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."</em> Together,
with the support of our dedicated staff and parents, we will continue to
empower our students to be thinkers and leaders who make a difference.</p>
