<p>It is a great honour to be posted to River Valley Primary School (RVPS) as the 7th Principal of the school – a school that believes in developing students as passionate life-long learners and becoming confident leaders who are anchored in values.&nbsp; I appreciate the hard work that the former Principals as well as the teachers (past and present) have done in shaping RVPS to become what it is today.</p><p>In RVPS, we believe that education is more than just doing well in examinations. It is also about character building and values inculcation.&nbsp; We strongly believe in nurturing creativity and curiosity in our students.&nbsp; In addition, we strive to empower them to be critical thinkers who are able to make sound decisions.</p><p>Personally, I believe that every child is important and given the right environment and support, he/she will be developed to the best of his/her potential.&nbsp;&nbsp; Schools are part of the society.&nbsp; Therefore, partnership with parents and the community is important in the education of our students. Together, we will provide our students with a unique and meaningful learning experience that nurtures each and every one of them to be individuals of good character, anchored in sound moral values, equipped with the 21st century skills and knowledge for higher learning.&nbsp;</p><p>Quoting Mahatma Gandhi,</p><p>Your beliefs become your thoughts,<br>Your thoughts become your words,<br>Your words become your actions,<br>Your actions become your habits,<br>Your habits become your values,<br>Your values become your destiny.</p><p>Our school vision, Inspiring Learners, Edifying Leaders, hinges on our school belief that every child is well-anchored in the right values and skills.&nbsp; The school mission, vision and values serve as the lighthouse that guides us in nurturing the life-long learner and leader in our students – with passion and strength of character through our distinctive programmes.&nbsp; I am confident that the parents will continue to journey with my team of dedicated and caring staff to provide our students an enriching schooling experience, inculcate the values and develop the social-emotional competencies in our students.</p><p>I am thankful to the previous principals for laying a strong foundation in the school, allowing me the opportunity to delve deeper into the curriculum and develop depth in the teaching and learning processes.&nbsp; Moving forward, the school hopes to create new platforms for our students to care, share, learn and motivate one another to greater heights.</p><p><strong>Mrs Jennifer Pang</strong> <br><strong>Principal</strong><br><a href="mailto:pang_chee_chyn@schools.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">pang_chee_chyn@schools.gov.sg</a><br></p>
