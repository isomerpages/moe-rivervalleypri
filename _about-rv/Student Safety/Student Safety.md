<p>At River Valley Primary School, the safety and well-being of our students
are of the utmost importance. We are committed to cultivating a strong
safety culture by consistently reinforcing the importance of safety guidelines
and responsible practices. Our students take part in a range of programmes
designed to build their awareness and preparedness, including Fire and
Emergency Evacuation drills, learning journeys to the Road Safety Park
and informative talks. We also partner with external organisations such
as the Singapore Road Safety Council and SBS Transit, who conduct engaging
assembly sessions to educate our students on road and public transport
safety. Through these efforts, our students are empowered with the knowledge
and skills to keep themselves and others safe in various situations.</p>
<h4>1. Safety on the road</h4>
<p>Students are regularly reminded to practise good personal road safety
both within and outside of school. They are taught to avoid jaywalking
and to always use footpaths and designated pedestrian crossings. During
assembly sessions, students are introduced to essential road safety skills,
such as the Kerb Drill, and are encouraged to apply these practices whenever
they are near or crossing roads.</p>
<p>They are also advised not to cross at road bends or between stationary
vehicles, where visibility is limited. Instead, they are guided to choose
safe crossing points where they have a clear view of oncoming traffic.
These reminders serve to reinforce the importance of staying alert and
making safe choices as pedestrians.</p>
<h4>2. Safety on school bus</h4>
<p>To ensure the safety and well-being of our students during their commute,
we seek the support of parents and guardians in reinforcing good behaviour
on the school bus. Students are expected to listen to and follow the instructions
given by the bus driver and bus attendant. It is important that they show
respect, remain seated and cooperate fully to help maintain a safe and
pleasant journey for everyone on board.</p>
<h4>3. Safety on public bus</h4>
<p>We emphasise the importance of safe behaviour while using public transport.
Students are regularly reminded to follow these important safety guidelines
when waiting for and boarding public buses:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Stand safely – Always wait on the sidewalk or a safe area away from the
road.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Board responsibly – Only approach the bus after it has come to a complete
stop. Wait patiently for others to alight before boarding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stay calm and use handrails – Avoid pushing or shoving. Use the handrails
and steps carefully when getting on or off the bus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seek help if needed – If any item is dropped near or under the bus, do
not attempt to retrieve it on your own. Instead, inform the bus driver
and ask for assistance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these simple steps, students can help ensure a safe and smooth
experience when taking public buses.</p>

<h4>4. Other road safety precautions</h4>
<p>For the safety of our students, no vehicles are allowed to park or wait
in our school carpark when parents send or fetch their children. This is
done to keep other students who are crossing the small road&nbsp;within
the school safe. This is due to space constraints, and children moving
within</p>
<p>the premises. The nearest public carparks can be found along Martin Place,</p>
<p>Killiney Road and at Zion Food Centre.</p>
<p>When it rains, parents are allowed to drive into the school to&nbsp;pick
up their children at the foyer. We seek the cooperation of all parents
who drive to school to follow traffic&nbsp;rules and regulations and practice
road safety and courtesy for the safety of all our students and staff.</p>
<p>At River Valley Primary School, the safety of our students is our top
priority. To ensure a safe environment for all, vehicles are not allowed
to park or wait in the school carpark during drop-off and pick-up times.
This measure helps protect students who are crossing the internal road
and moving around the school grounds, especially given our limited space.</p>
<p>Parents who drive are encouraged to use the nearest public carparks located
at Martin Place, Killiney Road and Zion Food Centre.</p>
<p>During wet weather, parents may drive into the school compound to pick
up their children at the foyer. We kindly seek the cooperation of all parents
to observe traffic rules, practise road safety and courtesy and follow
the directions of staff on duty. Your support helps us ensure a safe and
orderly environment for all students and staff.</p>
<h4>5. Safety during PE</h4>
<p>All students are expected to actively participate in the P.E lesson as
part of their holistic development at RVPS. However, students with pre-existing
medical conditions certified by a qualified doctor will be exempted from
physical activities. In addition, if a student feels unwell during a P.E.
lesson, they should inform their P.E. teacher immediately and will be excused
from the activity. For students with asthmatic conditions, it is essential
that they carry their prescribed reliever medication in their bags at all
times. All students are expected to follow the instructions of their P.E.
teachers to ensure a safe and supportive environment for physical activity</p>
<p></p>

<h4>6. Safety during outdoor activities – Lightning Warning System &nbsp;</h4>
<p>To ensure the safety of all students and staff, River Valley Primary School
has installed three lightning risk alert lamps at key outdoor locations
within the school:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Parade Square</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School Field</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basketball Court</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When the lightning risk alert lamps are activated, all outdoor activities
must stop immediately. All students and staff are to seek shelter and remain
indoors until the alert is lifted and it is safe to resume activities.
This system is part of our ongoing efforts to maintain a safe school environment
during inclement weather.</p>
<h4>7. Other safety measures to keep students safe in RVPS</h4>
<p>At River Valley Primary School, the safety and security of our students
and staff remain our top priority. We seek the cooperation of all parents
and visitors in observing the following safety protocols:</p>
<p>a) Visitor Entry Procedures</p>
<p>To maintain a safe environment during school hours:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>All visitors are required to sign in at the Security Post and obtain a
Visitor’s Pass before entering the school premises to meet with school
staff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unauthorized visitors will be asked to leave the premises immediately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parents fetching their children should wait only at the foyer or at the
sheltered areas near Gates 3 and 4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Entry into the school foyer is only permitted 15 minutes before dismissal
time. We kindly ask that parents do not proceed beyond these designated
waiting areas.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>b) Early Student Dismissal Procedures</p>
<p>To ensure student safety:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students are not allowed to leave the school premises before official
dismissal time unless accompanied by a parent or a related adult.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In such cases, proper documentation must be completed at the General Office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a rule, students are expected to remain in school for the full day
to participate in all planned learning experiences and programmes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No student will be released early without prior authorisation and approval
from the school.</p>
</li>
</ul>
