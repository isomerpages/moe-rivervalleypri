<p>To provide a conducive and safe learning environment within the school,
students are not to use smartphone and/or smartwatches^, during school
hours including recess, CCA and after-school programmes. We strongly discourage
students from bringing their smart communication devices (e.g. smart phone,
smart watches^, tablets, iPads, etc.) to school. We encourage parents/guardians
to relay urgent messages via the General Office staff. At the same time,
we recognize the need for parents/guardians to contact their child/ward
on urgent matters during dismissal or after school hours. In cases where
the need is genuine, we allow the students to bring their smart devices&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
upon signing the smart communication device contract. This contract can
be accessed via QR Code on the school website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>^Exclude non-telecommunication devices, e.g. POSB Smart Buddy Watch, which
allows contactless payment in school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The students would be bound by the following rules on its usage:</p>
<p>6.1&nbsp;&nbsp; Smart communication devices should not be seen, heard
or used during school hours, including recess, CCA and after-school programmes
(e.g. TAC lessons).</p>
<p>6.2&nbsp;&nbsp; For urgent cases during school hours, students are allowed
to make calls to their parents at the General Office.</p>
<p>6.3&nbsp;&nbsp; Smart communication devices can only be used to contact
parents/caregivers at the foyer, outside the General Office, after school
hours.</p>
<p>6.4&nbsp;&nbsp; Students must be responsible in the use and safe keeping
of their smart communication devices. Smart communication devices, which
are brought to school, are sole responsibility of the owners and the school
bears no responsibility for their loss or damages.</p>
<p>6.5&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-compliance on the use of any smart communication devices
in the school will result in the following consequences:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students who do not adhere
to the above rules will have their smart communication devices confiscated
after the second reminder. Parents/ Guardians will be required to personally
collect the smart communication device from the student’s respective Form
Teachers.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students who have any smart
devices in their possession during examinations and tests will be considered
as having the intention to cheat. This will be regarded as a serious offence.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The privilege of bringing
smart devices to school will be withdrawn for repeat offenders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; BULLYING</p>
<p>At our school, we have a zero-tolerance policy towards bullying. Bullying
is defined as any repeated or persistent behaviour, whether in person or
digitally, that is intended to cause hurt, distress, or humiliation and
involves an imbalance of power. Such behaviour undermines students’ sense
of safety, hinders their effective learning, and disrupts their healthy
development. Any instances of bullying are addressed immediately, and appropriate
consequences are enforced to maintain a safe and respectful environment
for all students.</p>
<p></p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY</strong>
</p>
<p>At River Valley Primary School, environmental education is an important
part of holistic education for our students. Our school aims to inspire
and edify a proactive and environmentally conscious school community with
programmes and green activities to promote learning and environmental conservation
efforts.</p>
<p>Each individual in RVPS is an advocate and a leader in:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
conserving water and energy,</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
taking responsible action to stop pollution,</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
maximizing the use of recyclable and reusable materials,</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
educating and participating in school-wide and community greening efforts,
and protecting, preserving and caring for the biodiversity of the environment
in school, in our country and the world.</p>
