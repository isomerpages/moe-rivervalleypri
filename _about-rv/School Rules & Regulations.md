<p>To provide a <strong>conducive and safe </strong>learning environment within

school hours including recess, CCA and after-school programmes. We <strong>strongly discourage </strong>students
from bringing their smart communication devices (e.g. smart phone, smart
watches^, tablets, iPads, etc.) to school. We encourage parents/guardians
to relay urgent messages via the General Office staff. At the same time,
we recognize the need for parents/guardians to contact their child/ward
on urgent matters during dismissal or after school hours. In cases where
the need is genuine, we allow the students to bring their smart devices&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
upon signing the smart communication device contract. This contract can
be accessed via QR Code on the school website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>^Exclude non-telecommunication devices, e.g. POSB Smart Buddy Watch, which allows contactless payment in school.</em>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The students would be bound by the following rules on its usage:</p>
<p>6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smart communication devices should
not be seen, heard or used during school hours, including recess, CCA and
after-school programmes (e.g. TAC lessons).</p>
<p>6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For urgent cases during school
hours, students are allowed to make calls to their parents at the General
Office.</p>
<p>6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smart communication devices can
only be used to contact parents/caregivers <strong>at the foyer</strong>,
outside the General Office, after school hours.</p>
<p>6.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students must be responsible in
the use and safe keeping of their smart communication devices. Smart communication
devices, which are brought to school, are sole responsibility of the owners
and the school bears no responsibility for their loss or damages.</p>
<p>6.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-compliance on the use of any
smart communication devices in the school will result in the following
consequences:</p>

Guardians will be required to personally collect the smart communication

smart devices to school will be withdrawn for repeat offenders.</p>

<h5><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>BULLYING</u></strong></h5>
<h5>At our school, we have a zero-tolerance policy towards bullying. Bullying is defined as any repeated or persistent behaviour, whether in person or digitally, that is intended to cause hurt, distress, or humiliation and involves an imbalance of power. Such behaviour undermines students’ sense of safety, hinders their effective learning, and disrupts their healthy development. Any instances of bullying are addressed immediately, and appropriate consequences are enforced to maintain a safe and respectful environment for all students.</h5>

<h5><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY</u></strong></h5>
<p>At River Valley Primary School, environmental education is an important

and edify a proactive and environmentally conscious school community with
programmes and green activities to promote learning and environmental conservation
efforts.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
taking responsible action to stop pollution,</p>
