<p>To provide a <strong>conducive and safe</strong> learning environment within the school, we <strong>strongly discourage</strong> students from bringing their smart devices (mobile phones, smart watches, tablets, iPads, etc.) to school. We encourage parents/guardians to relay urgent messages via the General Office staff. At the same time, we recognize the need for parents/guardians to contact their child/ward on urgent matters during dismissal or after school hours. In cases where the need is genuine, we allow the students to bring their smart devices upon signing the smart communication device contract.</p>
<p>This contract can be downloaded here.</p>
<p><a href="https://form.gov.sg/63c250adf2bd6c00123d4a21">RVPS Smart Communication Devices Contract</a></p>
<p>However, the students would be bound by the following rules on its usage;</p>

  <li>For urgent cases during school hours, students are allowed to make calls to their parents at the General Office.</li>
  <li>Smart devices can only be used to contact parents/caregivers at the foyer, outside the General Office, after school hours.</li>
  <li>Students must be responsible in the use and safe keeping of their smart devices. Smart devices, which are brought to school, are sole responsibility of the owners and the school bears no responsibility for their loss or damages.</li>
  <li>
    Non-compliance on the use of any smart devices in the school will result in the following consequences:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>Students who do not adhere to the above rules <strong>will have their smart devices confiscated after the second reminder</strong>. Parents/Guardians will be required to personally collect the smart device from the student’s respective Form Teachers.</li>
      <li>Students who have any smart devices in their possession during examinations and tests will be considered as having the intention to cheat. This will be regarded as a serious offence.</li>
