hours including recess, CCA and after-school programmes. We strongly discourage
students from bringing their smart communication devices (e.g. smart phone,
smart watches^, tablets, iPads, etc.) to school. We encourage parents/guardians
to relay urgent messages via the General Office staff. At the same time,
we recognize the need for parents/guardians to contact their child/ward
on urgent matters during dismissal or after school hours. In cases where
the need is genuine, we allow the students to bring their smart devices
upon signing the smart communication device contract.</p>

</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>^Exclude non-telecommunication devices, e.g. POSB Smart Buddy Watch, which
allows contactless payment in school.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The students would be bound by the following rules on its usage:</p>
<p>6.1&nbsp;&nbsp; Smart communication devices should not be seen, heard
or used during school hours, including recess, CCA and after-school programmes
(e.g. TAC lessons).</p>
<p>6.2&nbsp;&nbsp; For urgent cases during school hours, students are allowed
to make calls to their parents at the General Office.</p>
<p>6.3&nbsp;&nbsp; Smart communication devices can only be used to contact

<p>6.4&nbsp;&nbsp; Students must be responsible in the use and safe keeping

<h4><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; BULLYING</strong></h4>
<p>At our school, we have a zero-tolerance policy towards bullying. Bullying
is defined as any repeated or persistent behaviour, whether in person or
digitally, that is intended to cause hurt, distress, or humiliation and
involves an imbalance of power. Such behaviour undermines students’ sense
of safety, hinders their effective learning, and disrupts their healthy
development. Any instances of bullying are addressed immediately, and appropriate
consequences are enforced to maintain a safe and respectful environment
for all students.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY</strong></h4>
<p>At River Valley Primary School, environmental education is an important
part of holistic education for our students. Our school aims to inspire
and edify a proactive and environmentally conscious school community with
programmes and green activities to promote learning and environmental conservation
efforts.</p>
<p>Each individual in RVPS is an advocate and a leader in:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>reducing waste,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>conserving water and energy,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>taking responsible action to stop pollution,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maximizing the use of recyclable and reusable materials,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>educating and participating in school-wide and community greening efforts,
and protecting, preserving and caring for the biodiversity of the environment
in school, in our country and the world.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GENERAL</strong></h4>
<p>9.1&nbsp;&nbsp; We strongly encourage all students to maintain silence
at any assembly areas for the well-being of their fellow RVians. As such,
students are expected to have a book with them at all times, and to read
while waiting for their teachers at the assembly areas or in the classroom.</p>

be used or intended to be used to cause harm to others.</p>
<p>9.6&nbsp;&nbsp; Students should practice proper toilet habits such as
flushing the toilet and washing their hands properly with soap and water
after use.</p>
