To provide a **conducive and safe** learning environment within the school, we **strongly discourage** students from bringing their smart devices (mobile phones, smart watches, tablets, iPads, etc.) to school. We encourage parents/guardians to relay urgent messages via the General Office staff. At the same time, we recognize the need for parents/guardians to contact their child/ward on urgent matters during dismissal or after school hours. In cases where the need is genuine, we allow the students to bring their smart devices upon signing the smart communication device contract.

This contract can be downloaded here.
