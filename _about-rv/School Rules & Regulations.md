<p>To provide a conducive and safe learning environment within the school,

programmes.</p>
<p>We encourage parents/guardians to relay urgent messages via the General
Office staff. At the same time, we recognize the need for parents/guardians
to contact their child/ward on urgent matters during dismissal or after
school hours.</p>
<p>In cases where the need is genuine, we allow the students to bring their
smart devices upon completing the smart communication device contract online.
This contract can be assessed on the school website.</p>
<p>^For smartwatches, these refer to functions which are additional to those
of standard watches (i.e. time function). POSE smartwatches are allowed.</p>

<h4><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; BULLYING</strong></h4>
<p>At our school, we have a zero-tolerance policy towards bullying. Bullying
is defined as any repeated or persistent behaviour, whether in person or
digitally, that is intended to cause hurt, distress, or humiliation and
involves an imbalance of power. Such behaviour undermines students’ sense
of safety, hinders their effective learning, and disrupts their healthy
development. Any instances of bullying are addressed immediately, and appropriate
consequences are enforced to maintain a safe and respectful environment
for all students.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY</strong></h4>
<p>At River Valley Primary School, environmental education is an important
part of holistic education for our students. Our school aims to inspire
and edify a proactive and environmentally conscious school community with
programmes and green activities to promote learning and environmental conservation
efforts.</p>
<p>Each individual in RVPS is an advocate and leader in:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Reducing waste</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conserving water and energy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking responsible action to stop pollution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maximising the use of recyclable and reusable materials</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Educating and participating in school-wide and community greening efforts,
and protecting, preserving and caring for the biodiversity of the environment
in school, in our country and the world.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GENERAL</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We strongly encourage all students to maintain silence at any assembly
areas for the well-being of their fellow RVians. As such, students are
expected to have a book with them, and to read while waiting for their
