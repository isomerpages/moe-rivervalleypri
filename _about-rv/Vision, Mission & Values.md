<h3>Vision</h3>

<p>RVians are equipped with critical thinking, adaptability, and a growth mindset. They confidently navigate challenges, distinguish fact from falsehood, and make informed decisions independently. They possess understanding of their strengths and weaknesses, viewing mistakes as opportunities for growth. Their leadership is not confined to titles; they actively engage in their communities, fostering positive change. They embrace diversity, motivate others, and communicate effectively, fostering collaboration and advocating for meaningful causes. Anchored in values, they exhibit resilience, take responsibility for their actions, and inspire innovation to build better communities..</p>

<h3>Mission</h3>
<h4>To Nurture our students to be Future-Ready by providing a Total Education in RVPS</h4>
<p>Our mission upholds our commitment to mould the future of our nation, provide our students with a total education that is balanced, holistic, rigorous and progressive, and imbue them with knowledge, skills and values so that they are future-ready to fulfill their responsibilities to both family and nation. We engineer possibilities and enhance the opportunities for our students to learn, progress and succeed, so that they are prepared and ready for life and for the world. </p>
<p>Our total education nurtures our students to the best of their potential so that they may lead purposeful lives and contribute actively to society. Our strategies include (a) cultivating a vibrant and conducive school environment for teaching and learning with a forward-looking curriculum. (b) inculcating strength of character in our students. As our school prepares our young for the future – a future with changes and uncertainty – their character needs to be strengthened with strong values which will guide them towards responsible decision making. (c) Building up a team of competent staff with focus on excellence. Our staff is committed to provide good teaching so that we inspire our students to learn well. Our staff is also faithful to live lives guided by sound values so as to be role models through word and deed.
