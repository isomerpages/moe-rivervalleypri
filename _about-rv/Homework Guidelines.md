<h2>Homework Policy</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>At River Valley Primary School, homework is an integral part of our students’ learning. When used appropriately, it reinforces learning, provides feedback, and cultivates a love for continual learning.</p>

<h3>Definition of Homework</h3>
<p>Homework refers to any learning activity assigned by the school to be completed outside of curriculum time. This includes assignments and projects, but excludes revision and studying for tests.</p>

<h3>Objectives of Homework</h3>
<p>Effective homework can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reinforce learning and deepen understanding.</li>
  <li>Provide regular practice and application of skills.</li>
  <li>Develop good study habits.</li>
  <li>Encourage independent learning.</li>
</ul>

<p>Judicious homework allows teachers to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Consolidate classroom learning.</li>
  <li>Check for understanding and provide feedback.</li>
  <li>Review lesson effectiveness.</li>
</ul>

<p>Homework also provides parents with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Timely information on their child's progress.</li>
  <li>Opportunities to be involved in their child's learning.</li>
</ul>

<h3>General Considerations</h3>

<h4>Quantity of Homework</h4>
<p>We believe in a balanced life for students. Homework is assigned considering:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Age-appropriateness.</li>
  <li>Competing demands on students' time (CCA, etc.).</li>
  <li>Differentiation for individual needs.</li>
  <li>Timing (holidays, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Quality of Homework</h4>
<p>Well-designed homework should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be purposeful and encourage critical thinking.</li>
  <li>Relate to class learning.</li>
  <li>Be clear and well-defined.</li>
  <li>Be within students' capabilities.</li>
  <li>Use readily available resources.</li>
  <li>Be differentiated, where possible.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Feedback for Homework</h4>
<p>Homework should be checked with timely feedback, interventions, and support provided.</p>

<h3>Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h3>

<h4>Teachers</h4>

  <li>Set realistic deadlines.</li>
  <li>Communicate clear expectations.</li>

  <li>Provide intervention and support.</li>
  <li>Engage parents on homework matters.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Students</h4>
