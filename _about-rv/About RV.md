<h3>River Valley Primary – A Brief History</h3>
<hr>
<p>The River Valley Primary School (立化小学) journey began in 1985, when River
Valley Government Chinese Primary School, River Valley English School,
and Kim Seng Primary School merged to form a single school. This merger
brought together diverse traditions and strengths, laying the foundation
for the strong identity we now proudly uphold. With an initial enrollment
of 1,700 students, we embraced the challenge of building a unified school
community, one that values both heritage and progress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our school crest, with its three interlocking rings, serves as a lasting
symbol of this unity. In our early years, we focused on fostering a strong
sense of belonging, ensuring that students, staff, and stakeholders felt
connected to our shared vision and purpose. This commitment to identity
and community continues to define us today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2004, we relocated from our original site at 341 River Valley Road
to our current home at 2 River Valley Green under the PRIME (Programme
for Rebuilding and Improving Existing Schools) upgrading programme. This
move provided us with enhanced facilities to better serve our students
and to create a vibrant learning environment that prepares them for the
future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since our official formation on 7 April 2005, we have continued to grow
and evolve, achieving significant milestones along the way:</p>

</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the years, we have built a distinctive identity that extends beyond
academics. Our school is guided by four core values of Respect, Integrity,
Compassion, and Excellence. These values shape our culture, influence our
decisions, and serve as the foundation of the learning experiences we create
for our students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have also cultivated a strong presence in the aesthetic domain, actively
participating in musical performances and festivals that showcase the creativity
and talents of our students. These experiences enrich our school culture,
providing opportunities for students to express themselves and grow in
confidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we look ahead, River Valley Primary School remains steadfast in its
mission to nurture future-ready learners who embody our core values of
Respect, Integrity, Compassion, and Excellence. Rooted in a rich heritage
and strengthened by a spirit of innovation, we continue to evolve, embracing
new opportunities to inspire, challenge, and empower every student. With
a deep sense of pride in our past and a clear vision for the future, we
remain committed to shaping generations of confident, compassionate, and
lifelong learners who will make a positive impact in the world.</p>
