 River Valley Primary – A Brief History

The River Valley Primary School (立化小学) journey began in 1985, when River Valley Government Chinese Primary School, River Valley English School, and Kim Seng Primary School merged to form a single school. This merger brought together diverse traditions and strengths, laying the foundation for the strong identity we now proudly uphold. With an initial enrollment of 1,700 students, we embraced the challenge of building a unified school community, one that values both heritage and progress.

Our school crest, with its three interlocking rings, serves as a lasting symbol of this unity. In our early years, we focused on fostering a strong sense of belonging, ensuring that students, staff, and stakeholders felt connected to our shared vision and purpose. This commitment to identity and community continues to define us today.

In 2004, we relocated from our original site at 341 River Valley Road to our current home at 2 River Valley Green under the PRIME (Programme for Rebuilding and Improving Existing Schools) upgrading programme. This move provided us with enhanced facilities to better serve our students and to create a vibrant learning environment that prepares them for the future.

Since our official formation on 7 April 2005, we have continued to grow and evolve, achieving significant milestones along the way:
•	2005: Official opening of our new campus.
•	2010: Celebrated our 25th anniversary.
•	2015: Accorded the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in community service and student leadership, affirming our commitment to holistic education.
•	2017: Completion of the PERI upgrading, further enhancing our infrastructure.

Over the years, we have built a distinctive identity that extends beyond academics. Our school is guided by four core values of Respect, Integrity, Compassion, and Excellence. These values shape our culture, influence our decisions, and serve as the foundation of the learning experiences we create for our students.

We have also cultivated a strong presence in the aesthetic domain, actively participating in musical performances and festivals that showcase the creativity and talents of our students. These experiences enrich our school culture, providing opportunities for students to express themselves and grow in confidence.

As we look ahead, River Valley Primary School remains steadfast in its mission to nurture future-ready learners who embody our core values of Respect, Integrity, Compassion, and Excellence. Rooted in a rich heritage and strengthened by a spirit of innovation, we continue to evolve, embracing new opportunities to inspire, challenge, and empower every student. With a deep sense of pride in our past and a clear vision for the future, we remain committed to shaping generations of confident, compassionate, and lifelong learners who will make a positive impact in the world.
